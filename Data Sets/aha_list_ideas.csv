This would be vital in time saving and cost savings. Currently, if there are 2 or more procedures the surgeons wants to schedule, our schedulers pick the one they think is the biggest in terms of time and supplies (although they are not at all clinical and are wrong half the time). So only 1 procedure is actually scheduled and shows on the schedule in bold, we then have to type the rest of the procedure in the comments field of the EWS scheduling screen and pray no one puts a special character in that field otherwise no face sheets print. We do this so that there are not a ton a duplicate charges to address after the case.","caldwellmedical.com,cozadhealthcare.com,tifs.org,prairielakes.com,bhsh.com,interhealthcanada.tc,monroesurgical.com,lgh-jena.org,burgesshc.org,cpsi.com,surgeonschoice.com,ahmchealth.com"

The Electronic File Management application does not function properly in TWC, I can't have them use TWC system menu for some functions and TUX system menu for other functions, that is asking for mistakes to happen. Either ALL departments of a hospital have to be fully on TWC to safely use Communication Center, OR there needs to be an alert available when TWC screen is not what your working in, similar to when your in an online store, and you have asked a question to the live online chat, while waiting for an answer from the rep, you can navigate around your other applications, leaving the chat open in the background. When the rep replies to you, you would hear an alert, or the Chrome window button on the bottom task bar would flash, etc.Evident's Communication Center needs an alert to notify users that have TWC running in the background (for instance when they just use it to log in and navigate to TUX System menu) that there is a new fax, text, mail message.

The Billing Manager then has to go back and manually delete and reapply the charge to the correct date. The system should automatically do this.

DFE-I-1019,Allow Future Orders from multiple providers to be released on same day,"Ancillary,Order Management",Brent Runkle,Product Owner Review,2023-09-06 13:58:56,25,,"When a patient comes in to have a procedure done (Xray) and the tech sees that there are also future order for another procedure (US) ordered by a different provider, they need to be able to release both the Xray and US future orders so that the patient can have both done on same day. This increases patient satisfaction as they don't have to make a 2nd trip to have the 2nd procedure. The orders, whether they are from the same provider or not can be done on the same encounter. The billing department is happy because the encounter has the procedures and the ordering provider.",slhd.org,"Cheryl Hinman Sep 6, 2023
Having a patient have multiple encounters in order to do labs that are entered under future orders for one provider and radiology under another provider is not optimal. Most insurance companies will only allow 1 encounter billed per day, whether there are multiple procedures under multiple providers. But the process of merging becomes problematic with PACS systems as well. If the encounter that it the accounts are merged into isn't the one the radiology PACs used then the signed authenticated reports are not on that encounter.

This would be solved if when entering any lab order in order entry there was the ability to make it recurring and not a future order. Future orders need to be able to be released without regard as to who ordered the test of any kind on any given day.

Jennifer Baumgartner Dec 5, 2023
This process also causes our HIM dept to transfer charges between encounters adding additional time consuming work to an already busy department. We currently use RCM for billing so we do not have the extra manpower in our facility for this extra workflow. With our previous EMR, we set up rules in the system that would combine claims for us on the backend automatically and no one had to touch them. We had one encounter per Sub Type per day regardless of the number of providers or if multiple encounters were created it combined them all automatically on the billing side.

This also worked with RHC ancillary charges. We had rules that we would set up that if the system created a separate encounter (851 claim) for any labs, radiology, or EKG done in the clinic and there was another OP encounter for the same day (851 claim) for labs that are collected at our clinics and sent to the lab for additional testing, it would combine these encounters for us and be ready for coding. There is a daily list for us to go through because both of these situations happen frequently.

Sorry this kind of takes this idea in a whole another direction but has the same final patient and facility satisfaction outcome.","prmc.org,caldwellmedical.com,rpmh.net,cozadhealthcare.com,lgh-jena.org,dchbenkelman.com,olneyhh.com,slhd.org,fallonmedical.org,mcphersonhospital.org,pchsgrant.com,yahoo.com,bkhcs.org,mckenziehealth.org,kingmanhc.com,evident.com,monroesurgical.com,masondistricthospital.org,decaturhealth.org,gordonmemorial.org,cmhcare.com,arbucklehospital.com"

Currently our pharmacy staff stocks routine medications in a medication cart. The idea that was brought up would be the pharmacy staff would scan the medication prior to putting it in the patient's drawer to ensure that they are putting the correct medication in there. Also, this would ensure the medication is inventoried properly when the pharmacy stocks their shelves.

Just wanted to bring to your attention Situation 9816711. CPSI is wanting us to use Faxage however, if we cannot upload a file that is already scanned, then Faxage would be counter productive. Makes no sense to have our Medical Records faxes come in electronic, only to print it out and go through the batch scan process for a physician to sign. CPSI definitely needs to update\add the functionality before we can fully integrate Faxage at our facility. CPSI has added a product (Faxage) that can reduce our workload, but the Thrive System does not have the capability to fully maximize the added product. This is our biggest need is to have Medical Records go electronic, but we cannot upload a file that we receive and send it to the physician for electronic signature. Thanks

Laura Colbert Nov 9, 2023
I completely agree. With the way it is now, the item will be received within Thrive, downloaded, PRINTED, then has to be batch scanned in order to be sent to a provider.

Laura Colbert Dec 11, 2023
I saw this was marked as ""more info needed"", so I came to read it again. We can only send BATCH SCANNED items to physicians to be signed. Therefore, as I stated below, we now have to PRINT any electronic fax that comes in, to turn around and BATCH SCAN it so it is available for signature. ANY document should be able to be sent for a signature, it shouldn't have to be BATCH scanned. A lot of our things already arrive as a file, we shouldn't have to print them just to send them for a signature. That is working backwards. If you'd like a really good example of a fantastic INTERFACE between and EMR and electronic faxing, look at UPDOX and Amazing Charts.

I completely agree with what Guest states below. The problem just isn't with Faxage in our case, as we already use and LOVE electronic faxing, the problem is with THRIVE. Thrive has no way to handle an uploaded file, it can only handle a batch scanned file. That needs to be fixed. There are still MANY limitations to Faxage compared to other electronic faxing options. My offer still stands to give someone, anyone at Thrive, a tour of Updox and the tools it offers, and the things it allows us to with ANY document, not just incoming faxes. UPDOX is a very robust product that end users LOVE, Faxage is just a fax and has lots of room for improvement. We were rolling out Faxage, but we have paused, hoping that something else better will take it's place. It's great that it is right in the medical record, but the inability to send the items directly for a signature is a big thumbs down.

Again, I'll be happy to show you what we currently have with Updox, next to what we have with Faxage.

Communication Center - Faxing - allow fax assigned to pt to be routed for signature

We love Communication Center Faxing. We love that we can take an incoming fax and attach it to a patient and to a specific visit. Now we need to have the ability to take the attached fax and assign it to a user for review or signature purposes. We want to be able to route all incoming faxes away from our clinics to the HIM department who would review the document, assign it to the patient record and then assign it to the provider to sign so it goes to their home screen folder as an alert. We would also like to be able to assign this same report to an employee, such as the providers nurse, so they can be aware the document such as a consult returned and close referral loops etc. This allows us to get away from having piles of paper sitting in the doctor's office waiting to be placed in the patient record to having the information come in, be put in the record and routed to the provider/staff for review and/or signature through home screen alerts.

Laura Colbert Dec 13, 2023
Our clinic calls this a hard stop. They are thinking about changing to Thrive from the EMR they are on now, and this is a deal breaker for all faxes they would have to print and then batch scan. That's a HUGE step backwards in their workflow.

Nurses can communicate via the group as tasks are completed. Send as a Message or Secure Text is available in the abnormal lab results folder but that does not lead to an efficient workflow.

Hey Krystal,

I checked into this for you and Brent Runkle (Product Owner) shared with me that the summarized lab results alert will bring a user to the lab results summary screen which has these launch points. I updated the status to Already Exists per this information to avoid any further confusion.

If you need further assitance with this functionality, please open a situation with our support team and they will be able to help you.

Krystal Anderson Sep 3, 2024
This functionality does not exist. Let me clarify what is wanted vs. exists. You can double click on a lab result from the summarized lab results and can send that individual lab as a message or a fax, but often more than one lab test is ordered at one time. Let's say a CBC, CMP, Lipid panel, Thyroid panel, and HGBA1C are all ordered and drawn on a Friday. Monday morning results are back for everything but the HGBA1C. The provider wants to message the nurse to contact the patient with results and instructions. There needs to be a way that the provider can send the summarized results with all 4 labs that are done. The summarized screen would also let the nurse and provider know that the HGBA1C results are not back. Then she can communicate that to the patient plus she also knows what exact labs the provider has reviewed. The alternative would be the ability to attach multiple lab test results to one message or fax from this screen. The provider should not have to attach and send 5 different messages on one patient. Also, when the provider acknowledges the lab and then sends it as either a fax, message, or text is would be helpful if the attached lab included the provider acknowledgement. For example: ""Acknowledged by Dr. Burke on 02/01/2023 at 0956."" This exchange also needs to be viewable on the patient account similar to chart communication.

Arthur Dimpas Aug 14, 2023
Thanks for this request. We are having issue with our ED throughput since MDs are entering times in Notes but that doesn't flow to the log. It is done manually by our UC or a nurse, and if there is no one to enter the times, the log is not correct. We have a nursing order as a workaround also to capture the D/T, however, this is double documentation for MDs... sometimes, the time is not the same, sometimes MDs forgot to order. This is also a quality measure for the hospital, but the log has less value if the data are not correct.

Good afternoon Mark (and everyone else),

I confirmed with the development team this morning that this is an item they are reviewing further based on the comments made here and comments received at the conference last week.

Sabrina  Wiles May 22, 2024
Tom,


That is great to hear but this idea no longer has a status on it. What is the current status and what is the time line we are looking at for this to be implemented?

Tom Gardner May 22, 2024
Sabrina - the status is Future Development. I just realized it wasn't set to display that on the portal and fixed it. Sorry about that!

I don't have any information on the timing to share. Chason will provide an update on that for everyone once he has some more information to share.","tcmh.org,schcmed.com,fairfaxmed.com,caldwellmedical.com,pomerenehospital.org,wardmemorial.com,midcoasthealthsystem.org,rch-lyons.com,tsjh.org,jchealthcare.com,rpmh.net,allenhealth.net,bcmh.org,chsi.org,cozadhealthcare.com,trubridge.com,chmcok.com,woodlawnhospital.com,putnamgeneral.com,gmial.ocm,ajmchc.org,tc-hs.org,sphosp.org,taylorregional.org,gmail.com,lgh-jena.org,grapehospital.com,cpsi.com,clayhosp.org,westholtmed.org,ahmchealth.com,gvhospital.org,fcmh.biz,slhd.org,cfhis.org,gibsonhospital.org,fallonmedical.org,upmc.edu,pchsgrant.com,yahoo.com,att.net,prowersmedical.com,mckenziehealth.org,nrmchealth.com,hillsboroareahospital.org,madriverhospital.com,okmh.org,kingmanhc.com,eomchospital.com,smdh.net,kchc.net,artesiageneral.com,evident.com,rvmc.org,hrrmc.net,gmail.comaytwt,wcmhosp.org,girardmedicalcenter.com,hchd.net,ecmh.org,menaregional.com,alhnet.org"

Our providers send secure texts to their patients all the time from Communication Center. Most often to let patients know they received and reviewed test results. As an alternative, providers can send secure messages to their patients via the ""Communication"" application within the patient chart. The message goes to the MCC patient portal account. The problem with that is the only way a patient will get the message is when they log into their portal, which isn't going to be a regular action. Patients enrolled on MCC enter information on their account such as their phone number and email. The functionality of secure messages needs to be expanded so when a provider sends one, the patient can receive some sort of notification, otherwise patients and their families are clueless to the fact they have a message waiting. The notification via text or email can be worded like, ""Your medical provider has sent you a secure message. Please log into My Care Corner to review.""

The functionality also needs to be expanded to nursing staff as often it's the providers' MA that is sending messages or replying to patients for the provider.",artesiageneral.com,,"rch-lyons.com,lgh-jena.org,cpsi.com,pchsgrant.com,artesiageneral.com,doctorsmemorial.org"

Here is my info on this request:

1. When we create a sit on MyCPSI, it would be nice to have the ability to search by issue, i.e. if I previously opened up a sit for a ""medication dose not available"" or ""nursing order set not available"" it would be great if we could search that in our history. Currently, the only search feature available in my CPSI is searching by sit#, we would like to see that being expanded to the problem ""description"".
2. We would also like to be better to keep track of our open sits better, there should be a better way to track where the sit is at.
3. It seems that whoever starts working the sit with us, sticks with us through the process but then we'll miss a call and it's hard to get a hold of them. Can Instant Messaging be brought on to the platform? I think this will help A LOT.",dimmitregional.com,"Eric Detwiler May 18, 2022

Good morning Brittany.! We currently plan on having this request available within the Patient Connect application. Jennifer May reviewed and provided this information:

In Patient Connect, you can schedule and view appointments. The appointments are integrated to Thrive's Patient Scheduling application. We are actively working on the ability to check eligibility from Patient Connect. In order to check eligibility you will need a visit linked to the appointment. Currently, we have the functionality to create a visit automatically when an appointment is scheduled. There is table maintenance in Thrive to choose which types of appointments and the criteria to create the visit. We are adding more functionality on the way the visit is created. For more information on Patient Connect, please contact your Client Executive. For more information on automatically creating a visit when an appointment is scheduled, please setup a situation with Client Services.

I see the benefit in this, but do you think asking the patient to confirm at every message could be seen as excessive? Do you think the patient could get annoyed if they had confirmed the appointment in the affirmation and confirmation message and then we asked them again in the reminder?

Kenneth  Langworthy Aug 28, 2024
I see no harm in having the option in each of the messages. As long as the patient does not act on the links, no harm and the appointment remains as scheduled. Personally, I have had times where I have scheduled an appointment, left the office, got home, and realized I need to reschedule. Use Case: Lets say I confirm on the affirmation message. A blurb on the confirmation message could state if you need reschedule etc. use link below, If not - do nothing. The appointment should stay confirmed from the affirmation message.

Hey Linda,

I changed the status to Open to Comment. The TruBridge Analytics team is not at the point of delivering a self-service solution yet, but it is definitely in the plans for the future. We will have several people from the TruBridge Analytics team at our client conference in the hub, as well as several sessions devoted to it, so anyone attending our client conference should come visit them and share your feedback.

Janna Sartin Mar 13, 2024
No reason why reports should not be buildable within the Evident system. If the information can go it, it should also go out. Not requiring outside coding which is a huge disadvantage to the small critical access hospitals with limited resources that are your bread and butter.

It is important to be able to document %consumed on both the Diet Order and any supplements that are ordered especially in cases of Failure to thrive patients, patients with wounds, and patients on strict I&O or calorie counts.

Additionally it would be an improvement to have the option to include a volume amount when documenting on a supplement or if the patient is on a liquid diet in the percent consumed button area. Having the fluid intake function tied to the percent consumed area or vice versa would allow all the I & O information to be entered in one place this would be even better if the I&O console card had an entry button to address all Liquid intake, Meal percentage, and output for the patient.

So we have denied Whiteboard to non patient care users. This magnifying glass is just another means of pulling up Whiteboard. Therefore, if they don't have access to Whiteboard, the magnifying glass doesn't work for them, and they still cannot search by patient number.

Or make a dietary PDC card

Sabrina  Wiles Jan 18, 2024
Additionally when a dietary supplement is ordered it currently replaces the diet order with regard to entering the percent consumed. This is a patient safety issue because we can not record accurate I&O. We need to be able to record the percent consumed on the diet and also record the amount consumed on the supplement. As it is now only one diet order can have the percent consumed button active on it and it is always the most recent order. This results in the actual diet order having the button deactivated when a supplement is ordered.

Linda Pfeifle Jan 24, 2024
Agreed that there needs to be 2 different orders - one for a supplement and one for a meal. One order should not replace the other.

Linda Pfeifle Jan 24, 2024
Agree also that this needs to be documented under I&O as sometimes a dietary order is discontinued before the meal is charted and then it is just missed.

Kathy McMillen Feb 14, 2024
Agree. The vital signs tab could really be a ""one stop shop"" where the CNA or whoever is documenting can enter all of their information...ht, wt, BGM, vs, nutrition, percent of meal eaten. It gets confusing when there are so many places to go to look for info. Percent of meals eaten is a requirement for swingbed patients and if we were audited, it would be nice to be able to pull up a trend like you can with VS and not have to look at each day individually for that.

Kathy McMillen Feb 14, 2024
It would also be nice if there was a way this could pull over into the flow sheets when it is documented.

Sabrina  Wiles Mar 14, 2024
It would be nice if the I&O card in console was actionable like the vs trend card to add diet percent consumed, oral, IV, PEG TUBE, or any other forms of intake and all forms of output right from the card and it flow to the flow chart when entered there.

Hi Tom - Curious. Can you please tell me which POs are actively reviewing this Dream Factory Board? Thank you? Also, if this is a part of the nursing task list, can you tell me where in that project this idea stands in priority. Plus give an update on the nursing task list project itself. Not looking for an ETA. Looking for a 'we are this percentage' of being complete. Thank you Sir.

Stephanie St. Andrie Mar 15, 2024
Past Due Medications alert would be a notification on the Tracking Board where the other notifications currently display. I see this past due medication notification as the back end of the medication administration workflow if the medication has not been given. The piece that would be part of a Nursing Task List would be a Medication due task. This is the front-end task that would allow a user to give the medication to the patient before it is past due. I have talked to the PO over the Tracking Board application and this issue is being reviewed. As I am the PO for Console, I can let you know that notifications are not being considered for inclusion in the Console at this time.

As for the Nursing Task List, this is a project that includes many layers. We have started some of the preliminary work related to nursing orders needing structure. There are also other aspects of the project that are still being discussed and investigated.

Tom Gardner Mar 15, 2024

1. Set up as a Subscription Type - drawing from CPOE ordering provider
2. Allow use in all the lab folder setups AND in the Radiology folder. Not just one big folder for all ordering provider results and not just for lab results but also abnormal lab task type and summarized lab reults task type. Radiology task type transcription.

Today, If Dr. Susan orders a test and registration enters the attending physician as someone else then Dr. Susan never gets the test results in her HS folder. Resulting should not be dependent on registration. With electronic resulting, anything the lab does to route the results also has no bearing on results reporting under the current design.

DFE-I-1576,Tracking Board filter selection same as Whiteboard filter Selection,Tracking Board | Patient Search,Rashieka Coleman,Needs Review,2024-03-28 18:56:30,3,,"Reference Support Situation 9983968.


History:

Custom filters can be created for both Whiteboards and Tracking Boards. These are very helpful in taking a listed patient population and drilling down to get a shorter list based on user defined criteria.

Need:

We need the ability to have selectable radio buttons on the Tracking Boards like we currently have on the Whiteboard. EX: Create a custom filter and name it. We can have it present on the patient ribbon to the right of the default buttons. Select it. Select it with others. And have those patients display. On the tracking board, we can set up multiple filters HOWEVER we have to use the 'meets any of these' criteria to have the patients display. Which gives us a total list of of all patients that meet all custom filter criteria. We only want one of the multiple criteria.

Use Case:

I have a tracking board created for my nursing dept. This dept has all the rooms. In these rooms are in patients, observation patients, and skilled patients. I only want to see the skilled patients on the tracking board. I cannot do this easily. Currently I have to display all the accounts in these rooms and sort by stay type description. If we had the ability to create filters for the tracking board and radio buttons, we could get a WAY more accurate drill down of the patient population we want to see.

EX:

Observation patients are stay type 2 service code F and in a room.
IV therapy patients are stay type 2 service code I and in a room.
Build tracking board filters for both.
Have the filters present as selectable radio buttons on the ribbon.
If I ONLY want to see IV therapy visits in a room - select that radio button.
If I want to see BOTH IV therapy and Observation - select both radio buttons.

This function is already available on the Whiteboard.

Dear Trubridge,

Are you actively engaging with these comments? Could we possibly receive a more comprehensive update on the status of these ideas? We're eagerly awaiting to see the direction you take with them. Despite hearing that Dream Factory is the optimal platform for our ideas, it appears that even some of the most well-received suggestions are not gaining traction. Several highly popular concepts have been languishing on Dream Factory for over a year without significant progress being evident to your customers. This stagnation is eroding our confidence and belief that our opinions and ideas hold weight.

Tom Gardner Mar 14, 2024
Multiple Product Owners and other employees are reviewing feedback and new idea submissions. As we adjust our internal processes, you should continue to see increased engagement from the Product Owners. The status of an idea will sometimes be changed without a comment. Several months ago, we improved the status options to provide a clear update on the idea's current status. You can see the description of these statuses on the Dream Factory page within TruLearn.

Janna Sartin Mar 14, 2024
Oh look same canned response.

Sabrina  Wiles Mar 25, 2024
We still have no idea if some of these ideas are being developed. It is discouraging to see that some of the most popular ideas are just sitting in the dream factory but not even marked as in development.

Jodi  Mckinlay May 1, 2024
Is there an update??

Christi Keating May 19, 2024
Agree - either with the documentation of the start on the MAR or the stop, the fluid associated w/ the administration flowing to the I & O section of the vitals would create a better reflection of the pt's true input; not requiring nursing to make a separate entry is a significant satisfier.

Sheila Farley May 30, 2024
I appreciate the feedback and continued support of this enhancement. The IV Med administration workflow is an area that we have been focused on and will be releasing multiple dream factory enhancements for 21.08. We will continue to review the ideas that are receiving high votes and feedback, such as this one, for additional consideration to pull in for development. This will be updated as we continue to evaluate and prioritize our development roadmap.","prmc.org,stephenscountyhospital.com,schcmed.com,caldwellmedical.com,pomerenehospital.org,haskellregionalhospital.com,eocmhospital.com,hillsdalehospital.com,hbch.org,midcoasthealthsystem.org,gcmc.org,pch-health.com,raycountyhospital.com,kvhd.org,rch-lyons.com,medinamemorial.org,tsjh.org,cameronregional.org,rpmh.net,benefis.org,seilinghospital.net,vmhospital.com,hrmc.us,allenhealth.net,jackhosp.org,bunkiegeneral.com,emhcare.net,wahiawageneral.org,osshealth.com,keefemh.org,cozadhealthcare.com,emanuelmedical.org,emailsmc.com,waynehealthcare.org,bhsh.com,chmcok.com,putnamgeneral.com,haa.ai,ajmchc.org,tc-hs.org,pmhnet.com,sphosp.org,interhealthcanada.tc,gcdmc.org,commonspirit.org,gmail.com,lgh-jena.org,lifecare-health.com,mclaren.org,westholtmed.org,surgeonschoice.com,ahmchealth.com,gvhospital.org,fcmh.biz,labettehealth.com,gh-health.org,slhd.org,lchdhealthcare.org,gibsonhospital.org,thcs.org,pcmhosp.com,arkansasmethodist.org,taoshospital.org,trigghospital.org,knoxhospital.org,russellhospital.org,cahny.org,bradenhealth.com,pchsgrant.com,yahoo.com,grmf.org,foresthealth.com,mcboh.com,att.net,dalemedical.org,ccghospital.com,lindsaymunicipalhospital.com,mckenziehealth.org,nrmchealth.com,madriverhospital.com,starrcountyhospital.com,lapazhospital.org,okmh.org,bennettcountyhospital.com,camernregional.org,aha.io,mcmedical.org,protonmail.com,bgh.org,eomchospital.com,kchc.net,cullmanregional.com,desotoregional.com,artesiageneral.com,evident.com,monroesurgical.com,rvmc.org,noconageneral.com,hrrmc.net,asimgt.com,wcmhosp.org,spartahospital.com,decaturhealth.org,hardtnermedical.com,girardmedicalcenter.com,hchd.net,hillsborohospital.com,ecmh.org,arbucklehospital.com,hillrh.com"

If an order goes to a provider's E-sign queue they have no way to address it if it doesn't belong to them or if they didn't give the verbal/phone order to a nurse. E-Sign needs an option that will enable providers to return a verbal / phone order to a queue for reassignment.",artesiageneral.com,"Jeff Stuart Jan 13, 2023
This is a great idea. Even if you started with just a Redirect button that goes to Order Chron, at least it would guide them that there is a way to do it.

caitlin.broek@prairielakes.com Jan 19, 2023
Agree, and also a better way to audit orders. The report you run to see unsigned orders can not be organized by provider which is very frustrating.

Lori Luciano Jan 26, 2023
I have providers that would like an option to refuse to sign an order that they did not give. They would like it to go back to whomever entered the order.

Sara Kress Dec 13, 2023
The chart defaults to the attending provider, so nursing usually goes with the flow because that is usually accurate. But if the surgeon or the provider doing rounds when the attending is off, places a verbal/phone order it gets missed easily by staff. If the attending knows that they were not there that day, they can send it back to the queue or guess at the correct provider and forward it to them.

Mark Boomhower Feb 14, 2024
Just a question since I don't see a way to address the Status placed on this idea...""More information needed""...what information? Physician are not going to sign orders they didn't enter. This occurs in the ER and on the floors. If there's a shift change and the provider name isn't updated by either registration or the unit secretary in a timely manner, the wrong name ends up on any phone or verbal order entered in the meantime if the user entering the order doesn't switch it in OE5. Currently there's no way for a provider to reject the order. They either need to sign for something they didn't do or a formal letter with signatures needs to be submitted so it can be removed by Evident. It's an act of congress to have it removed that way, so giving providers an option to return the order into Order Chronology will greatly simplify the process. Because the order is unsigned, there should be a notification associated with orders addressed this way so the correct provider can be notified. Possibly a queue that Medical Records can use to locate the correct provider and assign it to their queue.

Janna Sartin May 31, 2023
Sorry, not Tara, but this question emailed to me also. I looked up those ideas. Those have to do with IVF stop times and is a very valid issue also. This situation has to do with dosage of add mixture medications being readily understood to prevent medication errors and prevent risk to the patient.

Tara Elliott Jun 1, 2023
Janna, thank you for your reply I do understand that this idea has to do with the dosage display within the eMAR and printed label. I am the person that entered the idea as we have had patient medication errors actively happen due to this issue. I do strongly believe the eMAR (pharmacy item set-up) as a whole needs to be reviewed and enhancements made to identify and mitigate potential patient safety issues. I also strongly believe that during this process consideration should be discussed on production or with the IV pump vendors about programming for interface as this information would have to be translated in that interface.

Tom, please see my previous reply to Janna.

Thanks Tara, I sent that information to Product Management as well.

100% agree - not having the dose visible from the MAR requiring nursing to click open the order and view the components is not intuitive and can lead to a medication error.

Christi Keating Dec 4, 2023
I viewed the video of the scheduled update and this does not address the view of the actual ordered dose on the MAR. Yes, it creates clear direction on the order components with two distinct columns but the nurse continues to be required to click into the MAR to validate the dose to be administered. Please reconsider the development of the order to be clearly written; i.e. display on the MAR VancoMYCIN 1gm Flowrate XX ml/hr vs VancoMYCIN/NS IVPB (missing the ordered dose) Flowrate XXml/hr Thank you.

It is not self directing, nor does it look well when being surveyed to say ""GIVEN"" for an IVF.

I was reviewing ideas to find one around stopping IV meds/fluids; so want to comment on that part of this idea - that a stop time reminder would be beneficial (i.e. Antibiotic infuses over 45 min, send alert/change color on emar etc that the med should be done).

As a floor nurse, I can 100% tell you that most nurses will not go back to say ""infusion completed"" with the amount of other nursing tasks. However, they might when they finally sit down to chart; granted only if they remember what time they stopped the pump.

Christi Keating Dec 29, 2023
The word ""given"" is open to interpretation and as an old school nurse to me this signals and beginning and end all together. Where as with IV fluids/infusions/drips there always needs to be a start and stop. ""Given"" should only be an option for a SubQ, PO, IM or IV route of administration.

Linda Pfeifle Jan 24, 2024
This absolutely needs to be changed. It is when an infusion is started not given. We also need a reminder to enter the infusion completely date/time - possibly in the tracking board, order chronology, and/or the MAR.

Shannon Walton Feb 13, 2024
I also think it would be beneficial to change the ""stop infusion"" to a ""pause"" or ""hold"". My nursing staff inadvertently choose the ""stop infusion"" instead of the ""infusion comp"" which doesn't pull to the report.

I will include this request and the information included on the types of treatments in the Task List project. We have this targeted for the 21.07 release.

DFE-I-1408,Medication Reassessment Report,"Medication Management,Quality",Sheila Farley,Open for Comment,2024-01-25 15:04:11,23,,I have been asked several times about providing a report that shows that medication reassessment is being completed. I can track this if they are using the flowchart for reassessment(albeit very cumbersome). It would be great if there was a report using the Medication Reassessment within the MAR.,prmc.org,"Christi Keating Feb 29, 2024
We are asking staff to use the system and watch for the orange alert on the MAR and then they perform the documentation in the system as expected. It would be quite helpful to pull this data entry into a report and monitor compliance. Thank you.

Christi Keating Apr 18, 2024
How can we bring this to a group of data writers for discussion and movement?

Caitlin Strapp Apr 24, 2024
It would be great if the reassessment transferred into the flowchart directly from the MAR. For example, if you are reassessing a pain medication, it would be nice to be able to put the full pain reassessment from the flowchart right when you perform your reassessment in the MAR. Then that data would transfer to the flowchart to reduce double charting.

Christi Keating May 19, 2024
Michelle - who is the owner of this request and how can we bring a group together to further the discussion?

Michelle Mason May 20, 2024
We opened it for comment to get some more details about that was needed in the report. I'm going to post an Administrative comment to see if we are on target from discussions I've had with customers.

Christi Keating May 20, 2024
The admin response items in bullet points would be great pieces of data to have in the report. Agreed all formats and export but better yet would be the data to pull to the BI dashboard. I could see how some would like stay type but definitely by specific pt as to pinpoint an investigation if indicated.

Sheree McCommon May 20, 2024
Web Client has an icon in the notification column that indicates a medication assessment is due. Double click the icon and it lists the medication that currently needs addressing and past ones that were not addressed. It would be nice to have a report.

Since this is a Joint Commission requirement for pain medication reassessment, we need to have a report to pull for compliance and non-compliance to show the staff where we are lacking.


PLEASE COMMENT ON THE BELOW:

Would like a report that shows all administrations of medications with ""Use Medication Reassessment"" selected.

Would like to see:

* Date/time/initials of administration----YES
* Date/time/initials of reassessment----YES
* Display blank if no reassessment----YES

Would like the ability to exclude medications with reassessment to only show those without.--- I would need a numerator and denominator so I would always want to see both and can sort within a spreadsheet if needed.

Would like to output to all available formats.----I like spreadsheet so I can sort

Are there any other parameters you would like to see like stay type or by a specific patient?----Need to be able to filter Service code as OP will encompass OBS and all other outpatients if you only use service type. We would be looking at ED, Swing Bed, OBS, IMCU, IH, IR, IS, and IP at our facility.

Need to run report by discharge date.

Need the type of medication in the report just as reference to see if there was a trend on a specific medication.

DFE-I-1596,Last Dose Date/Time automatically pull to D/C meds list ,Medication Management,Sheila Farley,Product Owner Review,2024-04-10 04:40:57,44,,It is a TJC requirement for the last dose date/time to be listed on the discharge med list. We are not getting buy-in from providers when it comes to entering the last date/time of med administration when performing D/C med rec/e-scribing.,att.net,"Kelsey Drouhard Apr 11, 2024
We would love a better/easier way to do this. I will say, the nurses are often the ones who know when the last dose/ next dose will fall due to timing of the paperwork and what they have administered or not. Currently our nurses go in and enter this info prior to every dc so it will print. Very time consuming.

Michelle Mason Apr 15, 2024
Do you have a copy of the Joint Commission requirement?

Sara Kress May 7, 2024
Our nurses enter it on every dc also, so that it prints. It is very time consuming.

Christi Keating May 14, 2024
It would be great for the discharge med list to have columns that show when pt's are to take their meds. For example - 4 columns; morning/breakfast, lunch, evening/dinner, bedtime. Then if the med is ordered BID, it would add an ""x"" or ""checkmark"" to the column of morning/breakfast & evening/dinner. If the med is ordered HS, it would then fall under the column of bedtime. For meds that are PRN, obviously it would not have a mark in the column as those are not scheduled.

Having the last entry of the hospital MAR populate into the d/c med list would help educate the patient on what they received prior to leaving the hospital assisting in reducing the chances of taking a med too early or duplicate.

Desiree Moreland May 20, 2024
Very time consuming and error prone process. This needs addressed for patient safety.

Tom Gardner May 22, 2024
Quick update that this idea is being discussed internally by our development team. Once there is more information to share, one of the Product Owners will provide an update. In the meantime, if anyone has any other suggestions for how they would like to see this solved, please share them for review by the team.

Sara Kress May 22, 2024
So, this is specifically discussing the Discharge Medications. If the DC MedRec says continue active, it will work. If it says continue home med and the home and active med are linked on the same line, it should work. When they generate the report that lists Discharge Medication, it would pull the last date/time that it was given from the MAR. That is what the nurse is referencing when they fill it out anyway, so it automates that step.

I picture the nurse running the report. The physician may place the DC orders in the morning when making rounds at 0930, but the patient doesn't leave until 1400.","ahmchealth.com,prmc.org,fairfaxmed.com,caldwellmedical.com,pomerenehospital.org,wardmemorial.com,mygcgh.org,midcoasthealthsystem.org,thcs.org,rch-lyons.com,vermont.gov,upmc.edu,jackhosp.org,yahoo.com,foresthealth.com,att.net,bhsh.com,mhsil.com,mckenziehealth.org,nrmchealth.com,childresshospital.com,tc-hs.org,pmhnet.com,bennettcountyhospital.com,kingmanhc.com,smdh.net,taylorregional.org,monroesurgical.com,rvmc.org,wcmhosp.org,gmail.com,lgh-jena.org,clayhosp.org,bsfmedical.com,nchnet.org,cmhcare.com,arbucklehospital.com,alhnet.org"

Nurses would also like notifications for new lab results. Currently they have to click through every lab since admission and exit before a new lab will pop up.

If a MAR format could be applied to order chronology it would fix so many things. Schedule Vitals / Intermittent Screenings / Dressing changes etc should all be on a grid rather than a list.

adalton@caldwellmedical.com Sep 7, 2022
Our team really misses our work list that we had in Centriq. Order chron is not as user friendly for checking off tasks. The Nursing orders need to be able to have a frequency added. For example: Dressing Change BID. This needs to prompt nursing staff at the schedule times to ensure that the order is complete.

Penny Smoot Sep 8, 2022
So many items get missed on order chronology. Really need a treatment administration record just like the meds so that you are notified of treatments that are due or late, etc. Truly becomes a patient safety issue.

Mark Boomhower Jan 10, 2023
This needs to include alerts for upcoming medication re-assessments as well, for example after a patient receives a pain med. There's already a Specialty Card on Patient Data Console for active meds, could their be color change alerts applied to that card or another card that can be created specifically for PRN and Pain meds that can trigger alerts?

",hotmail.com,"Jennifer Brockhaus Jun 7, 2022
We should add Medications to this also. At BMH our Clinic often refers patients to our Outpatient Clinic and we need to be able to order Medications and Nursing orders, as a future order, because when patient gets to Outpatient Clinic, this is a hospital account, so we need those orders on that account. Currently providers are either doing a paper order, or we have to call the provider to enter orders once patient gets to the Outpatient Clinic. If the provider could enter these as future orders it would make things go much smoother.

Another example, now that we can put future orders on hospital accounts, is if a provider discharges an inpatient and wants them to come back for fluids a couple days later this will be helpful also.

This would be wonderful if you could click on a vital signs order in order chronology and it would just open up the vitals and then mark that the task of vitals was done for that scheduled time or if you would enter vitals in the vitals tab and would just know it is for the time scheduled in order chronology and mark that task as performed. We should also be able to have that option for an assessment also. For instance if we have a nebulizer treatment that uses Pulmicort, when we administer that on the MAR it should automatically direct the nurse to do the respiratory assessment flowchart. For a pain assessment that is due at specific times, we should be able to basically check it off by just click on the order when it is due and then it take you to the flowchart section.

There needs to be a way in CPSI to lock documentation for Behavior Health/Psychology patients. At BMH we have both services and currently using paper for documentation due to they need to be more secure than what CPSI currently is offering.


A thought process I have for this, if we can lock down Notes based on Note Type, and it's controlled by Role Base Security, then we can move these departments to using CPSI fully. The piece that needs to be secure is the Documentation piece.


We would need to make sure if this goes to Clinical History it's locked down there also, currently if a patient is marked Confidential, their documentation still goes to Clinical History and can be viewed by anyone. Along with Print EMR needs to be secure. At our facility providers so often check the box in Notes to see previous stay notes and don't go to Clinical History to read these notes because one less click. So think this would be efficient not sending it to Clinical History.


I have visited with our HIM department if we can eliminate a Note with the Note type marked as secure, it doesn't go to Clinical History and it wouldn't need to go to Print EMR either. They could put the process in place that Behavior Health/Psychology patients they would have to go to Notes Section to print off the necessary documentation if needed. HIM feels an extra step on their part would help re assure that they are to do another check before just sending documentation out the door that shouldn't go.


This extra security would help BMH and other facilities to offer more services and keep documentation secure.

zobert@mvmc.org Oct 6, 2023
Along these lines if the mental health documents come from an outside entity there should be an ability to scan them in the system with privacy/security settings based on the image title. Maybe a passcode only providers who need to read the note are given.

Kenneth  Langworthy Dec 6, 2023
This remains an issue at Boone Memorial. I confirmed this with a visit to the NP who handles employee health/wellness. There is a paper system of documentation for employee wellness, behavior health patients, sexual assault patients, addiction patients, etc. This paper system causes work flow interruptions. Normal electronic working processes are suspended. They user fills out the papers. Then there is the the matter of securing the physical documents. And also storing blank forms used.

Potential Resolution:

A setting on the document to secure it. Document meaning a NOTE, eForm, flowchart, image title, etc.

A behavior control to grant access to the document for review. Call it - View Protected Document/Data.

Points to consider:

What do to with protected data if the data is discreet.

A system that places all the protected data into an area (database table) where it will not populate other forms of documentation. Data from a protected flowchart/eForm will not pass from a protected flowchart to an unprotected flowchart.

EX:

If data is entered into an 'unprotected' eFrom/flowchart, the data is stored in multi_app_documentation.

If data is entered into an 'protected' eFrom/flowchart, the data is stored in multi_app_documentation_secure.

If data is non-discreet, you don't see it unless you have proper security.

We really need this. We have an entire clinic devoted to drug and alcohol abuse. We can't have paper charts lying around. We need to have the information in the system, secure, and locked down.

Confidential patient capacity is needed for different kinds of visits also. Maybe if a patient is marked confidential it only shows the word confidential by the room number like on whiteboard and tracking board. When you click to go in have to enter the visit number to get into the chart. That would real time limit to caregivers as only they would bother to get that information.

The patient banner should be able to automatically update code status when a physician orders the DNR.

This is a HUGE flaw and needs to be fixed ASAP

Kathy Jackson Jan 26, 2023
Highly agree.... This is a PATIENT CARE ISSUE

Janna Sartin Sep 22, 2023
The new banner will show it when updated in demographics. BUT what scares me the most, is if this is not addressed in demographics it is going to say: ASSUME FULL CODE. That is terrible, it should just be blank! this is with the 2105.00 update.

Linda Pfeifle Sep 26, 2023
Agree that it should be blank if it has not been addressed.

KAREN ST BLANC Sep 26, 2023
It must be able to update if the DNR is revoked - I agree that it should be blank if there is no order.

Stephanie St. Andrie Sep 26, 2023
The standard of care is to preserve life unless there is an order or documentation not to do so. Assume Full Code is our default to indicate that the code status has not been addressed. We discussed with customers and assuming a full code unless otherwise ordered or documented by a provider is what is done in practice. From that discussion, it was decided that the default of Assume Full Code was better than leaving the field blank.

Our next steps are to work on making orders smarter so a provider's code status order can update the demographic field and the ID Panel.

Janna Sartin Sep 26, 2023
I agree that the default is to preserve life, that is expected throughout every facility. The issue is that the provider code status order does not update this at this point so if the order says DNR and the computer says assume full code that is a BIG PROBLEM and is better if it is blank if not addressed. I agree making the orders smarter would be awsome, but there needs to be a correction for in the mean time.

Nikki Csiki Sep 26, 2023
I agree with Janna that having any sort of default answer in the code status field is an unsafe practice. If you must, use verbiage like ""not reviewed"" or ""not addressed"" as these would prompt the user to search for the document(s). Even better would be to remove it from the ID Panel until Evident is able to meaningfully connect it to the physician order.

Samantha Sholes Oct 9, 2023
I agree, this needs to be corrected right away. If there is a physician order for DNR and the banner says ""Assume Full Code"", this is inappropriate and a major patient care issue. Please leave the area blank or use verbiage as above such as ""not reviewed"" until the banner is able to link with the physician order.

Kristan Michaud Feb 14, 2024
Updating the code status from the order is great, however, we need options for DNR/DNI and Comfort Measures Only to also reflect the ordered code status for patients.

For the Nursing Initiative project, first quarter of 2023, we are consolidating the order verification needs under the Verify Orders application in web client within the Application drawer as well as at the patient level. Will this request still be desired once that update is available for use?

Abbey Eskridge  Jan 23, 2023
I feel like that would cover it

Linda Pfeifle Jan 23, 2023
I guess it is better than going to a few different places. It would have been nice though if it all would have been on the order chronology screen so the nurses wouldn't have to go to another screen. Right now it is easy for them to miss if they aren't paying attention. Can you make it so the Verify Orders button/tab lights up red or something if there are orders for them to verify so it doesn't get missed?

Nikki Csiki Jan 23, 2023
Please don't put this in the Verify Orders application - that still forces the nurse to navigate to another screen for verification. It would be far, far better for nursing if you moved the entire nursing order verification process to Order Chronology. Just add a tab or something to perform verification, and some sort of visual indicator that new orders exist.

Stephanie St. Andrie Jan 23, 2023
There are also some other things coming in this project that will go along with this change to make a better workflow and experience for nursing. We are creating an Inpatient/Outpatient Tracking Board that will take the place of the POC WhiteBoard. We will be notifying users of new orders and results in the Tracking Board as well as indicating that there are orders that need to be verified within the application drawer.

This specific request for adding a way to access the Verify Orders directly from Order Chronology will remain open until we can get yours and other feedback about what we have done to address these nursing workflow issues in web client overall.

Mark Boomhower Jan 23, 2023
Considering the fact that it's the OC screen where nurses need to ""Release"" some orders (Pending Admit), that come via the EDIS pathway already Couldn't ""!Pending"" orders that come from the Held CL order queue be released form there as well? Then have the ability to verify ALL the orders from the same screen without the need to navigate to another area. If the nurse isn't in a chart, the same capability could be available from the Verify order queue as well.

Tracie Bastien Jan 23, 2023
get rid of the ""verify orders"" as a separate page/application. Putting the verification process within order chronology would: 1. encourage increased traffic to order chronology which would hopefully increase usage of actions/interventions available in that application as well as the overall awareness of the full active orders list by the nursing team. and 2. cut down on the number of different applications or pages that nurses would have to click on to accomplish any system function. If documenting against some nursing orders is done in order chronology, and viewing all current or discontinued orders is done through order chronology, then verify orders should be done through order chronology.

Chris Gabel Jan 23, 2023
Order Chronology would be the best, then there would be just one place to verify AND administer nursing orders. Centriq was like that. But all of the orders in Verify Orders would work better than the current method.

Sabrina  Wiles Sep 28, 2023

Does this apply to the application drawer at the top right of web client OR the left hand navigation that is specific to each patient? Please add some details.

Abbey Eskridge  Jan 23, 2023
both, but mainly the left hand side

Diana Trechter Jan 23, 2023
I agree with Abbey but would also really love to have the icons in top right with the tic tac toe icon be limited as most users for nursing are charts and system menu, however, would want the option to assign what icon's show in this area or to be able to ""hide"" icons never used based on ubl and not role as working in smaller hospital, some users have multiple ""roles"".

Nikki Csiki Jan 23, 2023
I was referring to the Applications along the left hand navigation. However, Diana makes a good point below, that it would be nice to hide unneeded icons in the right upper menu as well. Of the two, I think the more immediately beneficial change would be the ability to hide applications from the left hand side.

Tracie Bastien Jan 23, 2023
I agree with the previous comments. Priority would be the patient specific chart options on the left side navigation pane, but also the need to de-limit/hide any menu item accessible in the system is beneficial.

Sara Kress Jan 23, 2023
I would like to unclutter everyone's life, so my vote goes to both.

Lori Luciano Jan 24, 2023
On the left hand Navigation, There are a few icons I would like to remove that I do not want staff to use. But as I look at them, I believe the some are just awaiting their turn for updating. My concern is more in the waffle with the icons that staff had never seen previously, Financial management, System admin, Tables, Scheduling, Escribe, etc. I would like to only show what identity management states they have access to.

Stephanie St. Andrie Oct 31, 2023
In Web Client, the icons in the left navigation can be dragged up or down based on how much they are needed. Up to 4 of the icons in the application drawer can be pinned to the top navigation bar for ease of use. With these functionalities available, is this still needed?

Nikki Csiki Oct 31, 2023
Yes. Even with drag and drop, the applications along the left add clutter and can be overwhelming. Physicians especially only what to see what they need. Other users, like nursing, use so many of the applications that drag and drop does not help significantly, but hiding unneeded apps would tidy up their screen quite a bit.

KAREN ST BLANC Oct 31, 2023
Definitely needed to get rid of clutter in the navigation bar and hide icons not needed - would be able to hide those not used and would keep user from resorting to old navigation paths

Tracie Bastien Oct 31, 2023
I agree with Nikki. For example, I had one nurse call me with issues because her documentation wouldn't ""work"". Then I watched her...she was scrolling all of the way to the bottom of the list where I put ""documentation"" for her because that nursing department doesn't use that application, instead of clicking ""Flowcharts"" that they do use. Pushing it down doesn't solve the confusion and clutter that is happening. Thanks!

Sara Kress Nov 1, 2023
I would still like to be able to hide - by role or user. We don't use 3R, so we can hide that from everyone. System Admin only needs to be viewable to System Admin role and Charge Nurses to reset passwords, no one else should be able to click it. Table access is disable for almost everyone, so I want to hide it from most roles and be able to add it to HIM manager, Business Office Manager, etc. Scheduling can still be hidden from a few roles - Insurance, Dietary, Materials Management will never need to see it.

Cole Romero  Nov 20, 2023
We often have to tell various users when training that they can ignore most of the apps towards the bottom as they will never need them. It really would be helpful to just hide and make for a better user experience. I also agree with Sara that having some control over roles or the user for this would be great as well.

dnewby@prmc.org Nov 21, 2023
This would be great. There's no valid reason to have icons for applications for roles that don't and cannot access them. Having them there is just adding clutter.

This is a HUGE component to nursing documentation that should be prioritized. Leaving Care Plans in Flowcharts while moving everything else is ridiculous. Nursing is not prioritizing the care plan because CPSI is not prioritizing the care plan.

Some ideas for functionality: Anything charted within CW5 should have the ability to link to actions on the Care Plan. The care plan should have the same idea as patient education documents...if it is a diagnosis, then suggested nursing diagnoses should come up when choosing a care plan, as well as choosing your own. There should be an easy REVIEWED button that creates a time stamp and signature of reviewing nurse.

AND to be able to indicate whether the goal was Met, Not met yet, or modified at that date/time documented on. Would also be nice to have a ""notes"" section to be able to add in if family was present, and anything else specific about that specific care plan related encounter. And yes, if it could all print out for audit purposes, that is a need too. Also...not a must but if there could be a field in the provider note that would flow into the plan so that they could update any change in their plan while typing their progress note and it would flow to the Plan of Care, that would prevent extra clicks in workflow as well and really add to the multidisciplinary aspect of the planning.

No need to change departments to print them.

Clarissa Calhoun Oct 5, 2022
Yes as long as user has security to Master Selection, they will not have to change departments. They can go that route to access the patient's visit. Ideally users in POC and EDIS should not have to exit out of their modules just to print an additional label(s) and/or armband(s). This will save time and reduce the number of clicks.

And for case management that has to monitor several patients in different areas for different reasons. The patients may be discharged or current admits, having a 'my patient list' or 'watch list' for nursing would be helpful in TWC.

Adding this as a card, along with our current cards, would make using console as THE go to for nurse to nurse bedside handoff.

Lori Luciano Feb 15, 2024
This would steer the nurses and the providers more towards PDC. The Nurses and Providers could have a sticky note option especially for communication with other departments. But I would like it to function like the Tracking board where you can see who entered what and when.

Stephanie St. Andrie Feb 15, 2024
The Comments option has been added to the right side navigation panel. It was part of 21.06.05. I am including the release note for that change. This option makes the Comments area available from anywhere in the chart. With this option, would a Console Comments card still be needed?

Software Change: The Comments feature available within the tracking board in Web Client has been added to a new side panel that can be accessed from the right side of the screen within the patient chart in Web Client. Select the arrow at the bottom of the side panel to see comments. All comments will flow between the Comments area on any tracking board and the Comments feature in the side panel.

Within System Administration, access is controlled by the application ""Chart Comments."" This only affects the application as found in the side panel. This has been added to all Evident Default Rules.

NOTE: This feature is available for clinical charts. It is not available in the HIM Grouper.

cmclelland@lchdhealthcare.org Feb 15, 2024
We would still like to have it in hopes that our nursing staff would adopt console if they were able to have this feature there.

Stephanie Yoder Feb 15, 2024
I think it would be great in both places. For nurses who work out of the PDC it would be very convenient to add their comments there. It could also be in the side panel. All the comments made between the tracking board, panel and PDC would flow.

JD Toler Feb 19, 2024
My nurses report that there is pertinent handoff information that they would like to put into a PDC comment that they would NOT want to have posted in a comment on the tracking board.

Stephanie St. Andrie Feb 19, 2024
JD, could you expand on this for me? Examples of what would be needed for handoff vs Tracking Board/right side panel. This sounds like you are asking for a Comments/Communication card in Console that would act differently from the current Comments option on Tracking Board/right side panel.

JD Toler Feb 19, 2024
Correct. Nursing is trying to use PDC for bedside handoff. There are some details that they say is unavailable in a card. For example they may want to reference that a stool sample is still needed in lab but they do not want that on the tracking board comments. They use tracking comments for things like d/c ETA/waiting on transport or room assignment for the ED, etc.

JD Toler Feb 19, 2024
Stephanie, scratch that. After further discussion with the team the larger consensus is they like the current functionality of comments on the side panel and those still being on the tracking board.

I agree. At least make a hyperlink for the information on the panel. I would like to click on Unknown Gender or Code status and make the change there. If you click on weight/height value, it takes you to the vitals tab. The others should be like that also.

Stephanie St. Andrie Oct 19, 2023
The main request here is for the Admin Gender to populate to the WC ID panel from Registration, not from Social History. The Admin gender does not currently pull to the ID Panel. The Birth Sex and Gender Identity are what pulls currently. Do we need to include Admin Gender in the ID panel? Do we need a hover to tell the user that the second field is the Gender Identity and not the Admin Gender? Another comment is asking for a hyperlink to the Gender Identity field and the Code Status. For code status, clicking on the patient photo takes the use directly to the Patient Demographics--Encounter screen.

For now, Social History - Sexual can be accessed from Profile on the Clinical Info tab. These fields can also be setup as Profile edits to be addressed when creating a new visit. Social History - Sexual can also be accessed from Registration for New Visit on the Clinical tab.

Felicia McDonel Oct 19, 2023
Thank you for the information on the extra places to document. I still think there should be a hyperlink for the gender identity. Should I put this in as another Dream Factory request? At our facility, our clinical staff will be asking gender identity.

Kelsey Drouhard Oct 20, 2023
I don't need admin gender in the ID Panel. I just thought that's what the field was based on a situation I had on it. I agree with Felicia's proposal that it would hyperlink to the location to update that item to the correct thing. There are many many gender preferences fields now between registration and social history and the point is that the nurse should not have to click around to figure out how to update that to the appropriate designation from ""unknown"". Please add in a hyperlink functionality to the appropriate social hx field. I get your point about the Patient Demographics- Encounter but not everything in the ID panel is within the encounter screen so that still leaves users clicking around and that is just not acceptable.

Stephanie St. Andrie Oct 20, 2023
Thank you for your reply, Kelsey, I have updated your request with an Admin Addendum to reflect the updated ask. I have changed this to Future Consideration and will take this to the team for review.

To support a solid Internationalization (i18n), applications must be adaptable to various languages and regions without engineering changes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) .

Date and time is the most common format addressed in our software, although it is forced from code to a specific region. This tool should provide knowledge and guidance on adapting our software to be tolerant to localization and handle formats according to the user and not to server settings.

Beyond date time format, it should provide information about how to safely deal with measurement systems to consolidate them and give the user precise information regarding US customary, Imperial, and metric (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_the_imperial_and_US_customary_measurement_systems#:~:text=Having%20this%20shared%20heritage%2C%20the,half%2Dcentury%20after%20American%20independence) values.

Translations can potentially be adapted by region, not limited to languages. A tool should provide an easy way to translate the UI and messages remotely from native speakers.

Paper sizes as US-letter and ISO (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size) standards should be considered for formal documents in the PDF building process.

Numeric format systems can become a significant economic issue if they are not well presented. Applications must be able to mitigate the confusion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator#Examples_of_use) between decimal separators and thousands separators (dot or comma, in both cases).

Time zones are a problem not only related to geography but political decisions. This software tool should also provide information about how to determine an exact moment in time using standard time zone databases (https://www.iana.org/time-zones) .",cpsi.com,"Rob Resendez Jul 27, 2022
i18n (and a11y) should be foundational requirements

This topic has come up during some of our past tech/engineer ""summits"" (and many other times). IIRC, GRH probably has the highest maturity level around some of these concepts and I believe they have a contractor relationship that helps them create i18n strings and phrases.

A good starting point for us would be to collect user-setting to correspond to OIDC.locale and to include this assertion within userinfo and id_tokens - https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims

We have problems in the areas mentioned by Marcelo, but also in perhaps unobvious areas - like storing/capturing HumanNames in a way that does not lend itself to i18n - https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names

Many of our problems stem from foundational problems in how the data is stored. We need strict adherence - by all teams, features and products - to some set of principles... just as examples:

* Always store values with units
* Always store dates/times/timestamps w/ timezone OR at UTC (see above)
* Services: support Accept-Language (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) and Content-Language (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Language)
* Support OIDC.locale
* Use window.Intl (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl)
* Support OIDC.locale
* Use i18n strings files
* Support / monitor changes to lang (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang) eg: ing-bank/lion/localize (https://lion-web.netlify.app/fundamentals/systems/localize/overview/)
* Support / monitor changes to dir (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir) (rtl/ltr/auto)

nsmith@clhcares.org Sep 1, 2023
As we navigate the complex financial landscape of our organization, the need for real-time, comprehensive, and easily accessible data becomes ever more paramount. With the pace at which business decisions are made today, having a robust and well-designed dashboard tailored to our CFO and Director of Finance is not just a luxury, but a necessity.

Why this information is necessary:

1. Revenue Cycle Monitoring: Understanding our revenue streams and being able to identify any disruptions or changes quickly is key to maintaining a healthy financial status. This includes aspects like revenue growth, revenue sources, and patterns of income, among others.

2. Profit & Loss (P&L) Overview: Real-time visibility into the P&L statement allows for instant understanding of how the business is performing against its financial targets. It helps identify cost overruns, revenue shortfalls, and any anomalies that might need attention.

3. Accounts Payable (AP) Snapshot: Tracking our liabilities is equally important. An AP dashboard section would ensure we're managing our obligations appropriately, can anticipate cash outflows, and maintain a positive relationship with vendors by ensuring timely payments.

Key Features we envisage:

1. Interactive Visualizations: Graphical representations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for easy interpretation of complex financial data.

2. Drill-Down Capability: The ability to click on any data point or summary to get a more detailed view. This will allow our financial leaders to go from a macro to a micro perspective as needed.

3. Alerts and Notifications: Automated alerts for any values that deviate significantly from forecasted or historical patterns. This will enable proactive decision-making.

4. Customizability: The ability to personalize the dashboard based on specific interests or focus areas of the CFO/Director of Finance.

5. Secure Access: Given the sensitive nature of the data, the dashboard should have robust security features, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

In essence, we're looking to empower our CFO and Director of Finance with a tool that consolidates vast amounts of data into a digestible and actionable format. This dashboard, when implemented correctly, can be instrumental in guiding strategic decisions, forecasting financial trends, and ensuring the overall financial health of our organization.

We trust your expertise in bringing this vision to life. Please feel free to reach out for any clarifications or further details. Looking forward to a game-changing collaboration.

Employees who have been rehired can only their original date of hire, not the actual correct date (the rehire date) which causes confusion.",ksrc.org,"Waylon Moody Feb 2, 2024
Thank you for your submission. I have reviewed and wanted to offer a possible resolve at present.

3R Management Best Practice:
Custom fields are used to note employment history data as needed per facility. A custom field commonly implemented is ""Original Hire Date"". This would be used to house the first employment hire date of an employee. Then Hire Date field is used for the date of hire/rehire. The rehire date in essence is the Hire Date, which is desired in this request to display to the Pay Stub.
Using this, the Hire Date then would be true to the actual hire (rehire) date of the employee.
Custom fields to harness historical employment data are generally recommended. 3R standard fields are utilized for system functions, such as display on Pay Stub.
If Benefit Accrual is required to be calculated from an alternate date, the length of service date located in employee > accrual can be addressed to override the Hire Date governance.

Our Support team would be happy to discuss this further and assist in any Custom Field setup questions.","ksrc.org,reaganhealth.com"
DFE-I-1381,VIEW NOT DOWNLOAD FOR PAY STUBS,3R Management Suite,Waylon Moody,Unlikely to Implement,2024-01-18 13:44:33,3,,"A user cannot view or print a pay stub without downloading the pay stub. This is problematic as there are shared computers throughout our facility and pay stubs get left behind by previous users. This needs to be VIEW option only, if someone needs to print one it should be a print to PDF, not download. Laura Colbert",kchc.net,"Waylon Moody Jan 26, 2024
Pay Stubs viewed on a shared PC

Evident recommends that all users utilize their own network login to view paystubs. When paystubs viewed within 3-R, the stubs are download to the local download folder until removed. Because of this, viewing paystubs via a shared computer poses a wide assortment of security/privacy issues that are outside of our control.

Some but not all potential issues:

* In order for the paystub (PDF) to be viewed it must be downloaded in some form or another, if not to the downloads folder, it would be a temporary or cache folder instead.
* If the employee forgets to logout and/or close the paystub (PDF) itself, it is still viewable by the next person.
* If employees print the paystub (PDF) it is often also accessible from the printer spool on multiple computers if not the entire network if it's a shared printer.
* If employees forget to logout immediately after, the next person on the computer could potentially view the pay stubs (PDF).
* Employees viewing paystubs on a shared pc, may not understand that their username/passwords could also be saved in the password manager, allowing anyone to login as them at a later time.

To avoid potential pay stub viewing issues, we recommend that all users have their own windows login.

We also recommend that clients implement their own policies within Windows itself to help solve the above issues; if providing shared computers for employees to access 3R.

* Recommendation example could be to create a ""Guest"" windows login that is setup to automatically logout and clear all browser history/cache/downloads/saved passwords after just a minute or two of inactivity.

After receiving additional information and reviewing this further, the request is based on employee verification of proper benefit accruals based on hours worked.

A much easier method to review accruals and confirm calculation from an employee stance would be from their session, Attendance > Accrual Balances and Accruals.

Currently all employees can view their accrual balance and accruals which would outline each accrual based on time segments worked. This would be the best practice review for accrual accuracy and is intended for employee review. We would not want to add YTD Hours to the paystub for this reason.

To add, the 3R Pay Stub generates and displays font size by the amount of data on the stub. Adding YTD Hours would affect this and cause a much smaller font on the paystub when generated to accommodate.

* Bring the UX permissions into System Administration - one place for all permissions.
* Credentials also here from the UX side that control what shows on Notes, Progress Notes, reports etc but is also a good reference point for system admins.
* Show department user belongs to (Patient Accounting, Clinic, Specialty Clinic, ED, Hospital, Lab, Rehab, etc)
* Be able to ""Just Like"" all user settings. (applications, behaviors, screens, reports, etc.)

To have so many screens to create a user makes it really easy to miss something. A person creating the user profile, should be able to see all securities/ credentials in 1 location to be able to see that it is complete. To have somethings tied to Payroll set up (like credentials and VS entering capabilities) doesn't make sense. And then to have OLD security and New security screens just adds to the difficulty.

Another idea that came to the Dream Factory to die. #2 on the Dream Factory Billboard of Greatest Hits, and here it sits, just ""open to comment.""


I'd also like to add that the Physician permissions should be included in this fix. 2 different tables for permissions, plus making them a user in Sys Admin.

Dear Trubridge,

Are you actively engaging with these comments? Could we possibly receive a more comprehensive update on the status of these ideas? We're eagerly awaiting to see the direction you take with them. Despite hearing that Dream Factory is the optimal platform for our ideas, it appears that even some of the most well-received suggestions are not gaining traction. Several highly popular concepts have been languishing on Dream Factory for over a year without significant progress being evident to your customers. This stagnation is eroding our confidence and belief that our opinions and ideas hold weight.

Tom Gardner Mar 14, 2024
Multiple Product Owners and other employees are reviewing feedback and new idea submissions. As we adjust our internal processes, you should continue to see increased engagement from the Product Owners. The status of an idea will sometimes be changed without a comment. Several months ago, we improved the status options to provide a clear update on the idea's current status. You can see the description of these statuses on the Dream Factory page within TruLearn.

Tom Gardner Mar 14, 2024
Hey Laura,

We are evaluating adding a status option between Open to Comment and In Development that would apply to this idea and several others in an effort to provide a more accurate reflection of the current status of an idea. In this case, several options are being evaluated to provide a better user management experience, but specific plans have not been finalized yet.

Janna Sartin Mar 14, 2024
I do agree with the very eloquently put pessimism stated in the dear Tru ridge comment. Please take it as a challenge and prove us wrong.

Sabrina  Wiles Mar 25, 2024
Exactly, this is 180 votes and marked open to comment. What is the point of commenting anymore? If this is going to be implemented say so. If you are not perusing development on this very popular idea say so. Thank you.

Hey Sabrina,

Several options are being evaluated to provide a better user management experience, but specific plans have not yet been finalized.

We are also considering adding additional status options for ideas, such as this one, which doesn't necessarily need more comments or votes but is not ready to move to active development.

Great idea! What a workflow improvement. PLEASE consider this!! There is currently a disconnect, no workflow coordination between ordering, prior auth, scheduling, the patient's pre/or day of registration for th for the ordered test. Not to mention getting that prior auth info on the claim.


When updating this process please include fields to include the effective dates of the prior auth and the insurance company the auth was obtained from - that pull to registration and the claim. Our site began having issues during Covid of patients scheduled and prior auth'd for the MRI or joint injection, but they rescheduled when Covid rates would spike or just due to having Covid themselves. By the time they actually presented for the test their authorization dates expired &/or they changed MCD MCO plans. This has continued to be an issue.

With so many insurances increasing their prior auth requirements and decreasing span of auth dates we truly need the scheduling/prior auth/registration/ancillary order functions to communicate! Not to mention OR is still on EWS and requires another process to record, locate and get the prior auth info on the claim.

our providers are also wanting a way to access their OR schedule from our website. They want their office to be able to upload patient registration information, auth, procedure CPT codes, and pick what day on the OR schedule they would like the case to be. Then they would want their office to be able to get confirmation that information was successfully uploaded.

To add onto this providers and nurses need to be able to take a picture of things and then upload it to the patient's chart like a wound, etc and I tried this on web client today from my iPhone but it requires Thrive Helper to utilize Scanned Images but can't do that on a phone so we had to email the image to ourselves to uploade on a computer and that just puts security and HIPAA at risk having to send via email and all that so really need more mobile access for more security.

Cassi Loutzenhiser Jun 22, 2023
Yes we loaded 21.04 right after we returned from conference. I already have a Situation open regarding Scanned Images option not showing for providers in the phys role cause nursing roles have it but phys role doesn't and I couldn't find any application or behavior or screen security to add that nursing had that they didn't and prior to that I had already hunted through the release notes and I just searched again and nowhere does it list any setup required for Scanned Images app within Web Client and it only says that Scanned Images functionality was added to Web Client and the Nursing role got it automatically without any prompting from me and I use web client exclusively and of course already have Thrive Helper installed because of that (I'm not talking about the one that makes you launch Thrive Ux, I'm referencing the Thrive Helper that is installed so that you can access System Menu, clindoc, etc from right within web client & NOT launching TUX) it doesn't prompt me to download thrive helper but when I clicked on Scanned Images from within web client on my iphone it prompted that thrive helper was needed and tried to download and install but of course you can't do that on iphone so Scanned Images currently is completely inaccessible unless you are on an actual computer and have thrive helper already installed.

Changed to Open to Comment. Since Medical History in the Health History application is currently the Problem List (Diagnosis List), I think that is the confusion as to why this was considered an Already Exists. What is the expectation for a Past Medical History filter? What information from the Health History application is to be included? What other information that is not available in Health History needs to be considered? Is this a comprehensive list of all information within the Health History application?

Lori Luciano Jan 24, 2024
Nurses are filling in the smoking, drug, drinking history in great detail and the data cannot pull to Notes or the PDC card. This information is important especially when the guest will tell the nurse about a drug history and then deny to providers or decrease the amount. In addition, the family history is nice to enter in the Health History, but the information goes nowhere. That is the big frustration. The health History has been nicely developed, but the information does not pull to important places - Notes and PDC.

In my dream world....I would like to see the Health History that has a great review of systems to enter in the Medical history, then this could be the profile level of a guests health history with documents that attach as reference, such as EKGs, PFT results, etc.

Lori Luciano Jan 25, 2024
Per My Facility the Nurses have never been comfortable with the Problem list and the Providers are kind of protective of the list. Medical History would then be more Nursing ""owned"". Maybe the Problem list auto flows to the Health History and Nursing can make their notes/ List. Instead of having to mark the Add to medical history checkbox.

We recommend report code MAR be set up for downtime procedures, not the Scheduled Medication Report. Which is either the Temp MAR or the 5 Day MAR depending on what they have set up to pull by stay type. It's the only medication specific report we have that goes to PC Backup.

I'd like to get more information about what you want to see, where you'd want to see it, and when you'd need it based on your workflow/patient visit. We have a number of validated risk assessments and screening tools, such as Braden and Morse Fall, in our AHT and Thrive content.

Within Thrive, we have them in the content included in Documentation, the best practice POC flowcharts which are posted in CPSIQ, and in some of the CPSI Templates available for Notes. We're still working on our best practice eforms for the Eforms Sharing Library. We can certainly prioritize some of these so they are available sooner.

If you're using any of these, will you share some of the pain points you're currently experiencing or give some insight on what you hope to see? Are you looking for additional functionality with the documentation we already offer? Do you need a way to have the information quickly shared with different users or settings? Do you need a better way to compare the results for a single patient or across multiple patients?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kelsey Drouhard Jul 21, 2022
Agree, I would like an intuitive scale. Something that would generate an order based off of what the scale evaluated.

Nikki Csiki Jan 12, 2023
I think it would be enormously beneficial if many of these repetitive assessment scores displayed in or like the VS application as they are used throughout the patient stay for medical decision making by nurses, anesthesia, provders, and pharmacists. This would be things like RASS, CIWA-Ar, Morse, Pasero, Aldrette, Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool, a standardized VTE Risk assessment, NIH Stroke Scale, Glasgow Coma Scale, SOFA, qSOFA, COWS, and more. This would allow ability to view trends quickly as well as add documentation readily (some assessments can be as often as every 15 minutes). Some are built into Documentation, but to use them anywhere else, they have to be tediously recreated. Additionally, Flow Charts and Eforms are character limited causing us to make changes in wording that really should not/cannot occur due to copywrite and/or evidence-based guidelines.

Kelsey Drouhard Apr 19, 2023
@Mary Sammartino - can we set up a group call with Diana, myself, Nikki, and you to discuss? I know I am really wanting something that I can build to generate orders based on clicks or scores. The VTE is a huge headache and it's just extremely piecey to get everything done appropriately for the patient. I think theres like 3 different locations/workflows just to meet this one need. In my opinion - the piece that is really missing is the ability to evaluate, score/scale, and generate orders within the same workflow. Thanks

Diana Trechter Oct 10, 2023
I agree with above. with the ones built in flowcharts and stuff, staff use but it gets bulky. Ideally if we are going to something like notes for nursing documentation, you could have option to insert these as templates but would want them to calculate and then be able to order our of notes like we could in phys doc. The issue with flowcharts is the character limitation. Right now i am trying to build into our flowchart initial interview the new SDOH questions but no way to shorten questions enough to make sense so am in process of making a whole new initial interview in e-forms, however i am finding some things in flowchart process that don't work in eform process but will working on switching to test. One issue with the eforms is the not auto saving, as this makes nursing anxious as its a longer form they traditionally use.

Another big part of these scales is they really should be standard and in e-forms, with no calculation there is no database code to have it populate anywhere or run QI. It would be great (this is another wish) also to have these different scores have the ability to be ""assigned"" as task and would remind nurse when they are do and/or competed, with the option to re-assess in 4 hours, daily, etc. Not having a timed option to set task, including things like dressing changes, special assessments, pain assessment, etc is always a patient concern.","prmc.org,caldwellmedical.com,hillsdalehospital.com,rch-lyons.com,jackhosp.org,bunkiegeneral.com,cozadhealthcare.com,emailsmc.com,bhsh.com,putnamgeneral.com,ajmchc.org,pmhnet.com,interhealthcanada.tc,lgh-jena.org,westholtmed.org,franklinfoundation.org,surgeonschoice.com,ahmchealth.com,fcmh.biz,gibsonhospital.org,vermont.gov,upmc.edu,yahoo.com,grmf.org,lindsaymunicipalhospital.com,nrmchealth.com,madriverhospital.com,okmh.org,kingmanhc.com,eomchospital.com,artesiageneral.com,evident.com,monroesurgical.com,noconageneral.com,wcmhosp.org"

The new audit especially the change logs has proven valuable to sites and useful in troubleshooting our EHR.
Currently the Security Audit Screen, the high level screen report that defines all transactions in a columnar format per the ASTM standard, has two export options. A CSV export that is useful in investigation as well as a PDF option that will PDF the rows on the screen in a formal print report with the ""Generated by Thrive EHR"" watermark in the header that provides formal proof that the audit went from tamper resistant db to a PDF. Because of timing back then, including these two helpful tools proved to be a bit more complicated for the Change Log, so we decided to wait until there was signficant need for these capabilities across the user base before taking another look.

IMPROVEMENT

When a site is audited for promoting interoperability (MU), they must produce documentation that shows when specific settings are set. For example, enabling CDS Alerts or Setting Drug to Drug Clinical Interactions. This information is stored in the _aulog table and available to sites through the change log screen for that table. The need has arrived for a formal report from the _aulog tables via the Change Log Screen.

Looking for an update on this. It is an absolute requirement for pediatric dosing. We report this out as a quality metric, and we have several workarounds and manual data extraction practices to try and make sure providers are manually documenting this somewhere in the chart.

Nikki Csiki Nov 13, 2023
The actual dosing calculation itself MUST be included as a part of the order, not just the answer to the calculation. This means that the provider should be prompted (or required) within the order at the point of order entry to include this information and it should be in a dedicated field. Currently, the dose calculator is separate from the order, so does not meet the requirement.

Michelle Mason Nov 13, 2023
The Dose Calculator with the calculation that was used is available to review from Order Detail after the order is placed for pharmacy and nurse verification. Are you wanting the calculation to print to the PEOR?

Nikki Csiki Nov 13, 2023
I would like to see it attached to the order itself rather than several clicks in. It would also be preferable to have a dedicated field within the body of the order as a prompt, and better still if we could require it based on age and particular medication; this would prevent calculation outside of the application (calculator, paper) because part of the requirement is that it must be clear how the provider determined the dose (all steps shown).

This should be separated into cosigner for Notes (we have some notes, like face to face that can done by APRN but a MD needs to cosign them.

You can currently add orders from multiple physicians when lab places orders.",cmhcare.com,"Clarissa Calhoun Jul 12, 2023
Patients that have multiple future orders from different providers requires staff to create an account for each provider that has a future order. This is so that providers can receive an alert when the order is completed and ordering provider is name is on the results. Ancillary can manually enter in a different provider's order via Department Order Entry Screen. They can change the ordering provider to the other one; however, the other provider will get notification in their task to sign off on order. This is not the same as releasing another providers future order. Currently no one can release another providers order after another provider's future orders have been released. This results in registration of multiple same day accounts and each will have charges, orders, and results.


This also requires a lot of time for Revenue Cycle and Medical Records to clean up and correct. Insurance payers typically require same day Hospital Outpatient Services are billed on one account. If the accounts are not combined or one gets missed, billing team is looking at rebill, fighting denials/appeals, and/or have to write-off. Staff have to run a readmissions report to find same dates of service accounts. Review each account account detail, order, and results, to verify that the accounts are truly same day. Manually Transfer Charges all OP same day charges to one account. There is not way of ""merging clinical EHR Chart"". Medical Records will typically download/print orders and results then upload/scan from all into the one account. Code the account. The left over same day accounts are out there as duplicates and can no longer be used. So staff have to make sure that they remove insurances off and make sure AR balance so it can purge to clinical history.

Hi Mary, thank you for your response. I did test the Patient Data Console and created a Nursing Shift Board.

It would be great if there were a printable version of the board similar to the 24hr patient summary that nurses can use to write notes and ""scribble"" on when doing their rounds.

This would be great if it would be more customizable. We have one shift print it off for the next shift and noticed that if the start date/time isn't here yet, then the medications do not show up on the sheet. There is an option to add future medications but then it adds all future medications no matter what the start date/time which isn't good either. Like you said, it needs to be customizable so they can pick and choose what to be on there.

This is a very big work flow issue.,keefemh.org,"Michelle Mason Nov 6, 2023
Can you elaborate on where you are in the system when it does not log you back to the page you were on? I have tested with the auto time out and with locking manually. When entering my password, I am taken back to the screen I was on even if a dialogue window was open.

Jeanette  Adams  Nov 7, 2023
Using Imprivata to autofill username and password, when it times out due to inactivity, it gives you the option to sign out or resume. If you select resume, it will act like it is logging you back in, but then it gives you a screen message to contact system administrator for password reset. If you select sign out it will auto fill your login information and sign you back in to TWC, but takes you back to the Home page/Task screen.

Michelle Mason Nov 7, 2023
In this case, autofill is filling in both the username and the password, however, the only open field is the password. If I type my password then tab (to the Forgot Password option), I get the same message when clicking Enter. Typing in my password and then clicking Sign In or Enter resumes my session as it was. Have you tested with just entering your password?

Cassi Loutzenhiser Nov 7, 2023
We don't even have a time out set and randomly throughout the day it just signs me out and I'm back on the main login page again. I haven't been able to find the cause of getting signed out at all since we don't have an auto sign out it should keep me logged in all the time but it doesn't. I'll have 3 tabs open and lock my windows screen and go do stuff and when I come back all 3 tabs are logged out all the way to the beginning login screen again. Only happens on Web Client for me.

Jeanette  Adams  Nov 8, 2023
It autofills the password line (assuming with my username) and processes automatically. It doesn't give me a chance to only enter the password. The staff really does not want to have to manually enter their password and so would rather lose their last screen and have the autofill, but it would be nice if the autofill would just enter the password and not both and they could resume where they were at.

Michelle Mason Nov 8, 2023
You may want to open a situation to review your setup. Department setup overrides facility.

Michelle Mason Nov 8, 2023
This would be an issue to review with your autofill application. I'd imagine that if you highlighted your user name it might work but understand you may not want to do that.

KAREN ST BLANC Nov 8, 2023
Our experience is when timed out and ""Resume"" is selected, we are taken to the screen that was open when timed out.

Cassi Loutzenhiser Nov 8, 2023
I haven't opened a Sit yet but I did know that Department Setup overrides facility as we had a major issue surrounding that BUT when you are in Web Client you aren't in System Menu and you aren't changing your Department so how does Web Client know what Department you are in to follow that setup? Because of the major issue we were having we already removed or extended to max all the Department time outs so I wouldn't think this would affect it anyhow but just a minute ago I got completely signed out yet again and it goes all the way to the initial login screen, not the ""signed out"" screen where you just enter your password and can get right back to the same exact screen you were on so I was under the same impression this other person was that it didn't function correctly in Web Client but you're saying if you get timed out in web client that you should get the same locked screen you get with Thrive UX? If so then I have a totally different issue going on and I suppose I should put a Sit in.

Yes. It sounds like something outside the Resume. If you click on your initials in the top, right and then click Lock, you'll see how the time out should function.

A notification exists for new orders via the Verify Orders Badge as well as the Tracking Board Verify Orders icon. This was available with the 2104.00 release in Web Client. We have also added a notification to the Tracking Board for medication reassessment which is available on the 21.06.00 release. We have more notifications in the planning stage. New communication message notification is mentioned. I think you are referring to a new Communication Center message. I would like more information on specific notifications requested and your thoughts on priority for addressing them.

TWC does not work entirely for registration and medical records. 2 of the departments that would use communication center the most. The Electronic File Management application does not function properly in TWC, I can't have them use TWC system menu for some functions and TUX system menu for other functions, that is asking for mistakes to happen. Either ALL departments of a hospital have to be fully on TWC to safely use Communication Center, OR there needs to be an alert available when TWC screen is not what your working in, similar to when your in an online store, and you have asked a question to the live online chat, while waiting for an answer from the rep, you can navigate around your other applications, leaving the chat open in the background. When the rep replies to you, you would hear an alert, or the Chrome window button on the bottom task bar would flash, etc.Evident's Communication Center needs an alert to notify users that have TWC running in the background (for instance when they just use it to log in and navigate to TUX System menu) that there is a new fax, text, mail message.","prmc.org,caldwellmedical.com,rheamedical.org,rch-lyons.com,vmhospital.com,allenhealth.net,reaganhealth.com,cozadhealthcare.com,choctawregional.com,woodlawnhospital.com,putnamgeneral.com,haa.ai,ajmchc.org,gmail.com,lgh-jena.org,grapehospital.com,westholtmed.org,surgeonschoice.com,ahmchealth.com,fcmh.biz,gh-health.org,kimballhealth.org,upmc.edu,grmf.org,lindsaymunicipalhospital.com,chomepgh.org,artesiageneral.com,monroesurgical.com,pinevillehospital.org"

Currently, it's only possible to answer YES or NO to contrast use which leads to charges dropping for the entire 100ml bottle. CMS and insurance companies look for the amount of contrast used and the amount wasted and it causes problems when accounts are submitted for billing. The way that waste amounts are currently documented is cumbersome and not easily within the workflow for Rad Techs. There isn't a way on the order maintenance screen where the tech completes the exam that allows them to enter the amount of contrast used and the amount wasted...there needs to be some sort of option that allows them to capture the documentation without going outside their normal workflow.",artesiageneral.com,"Susan Gutjahr Aug 3, 2023
I agree with Mark that contrast use and waste by the radiology tech must be addressed. CMS recently placed a requirement that we use a modifier to show no waste vs waste and the currently process can lead to fraudulent billing because there is not a field to document waste of the 100ml bottle. I realize this must be coordinated with billing so that the appropriate modifier drops on the waste line vs the non-waste line but the time has come. Also, there has to be a way for ADM facilities to identify this to charge on admin by radiology outside the use of a MAR.","prmc.org,schcmed.com,caldwellmedical.com,hillsdalehospital.com,gcmc.org,rpmh.net,cozadhealthcare.com,yahoo.com,bhsh.com,nrmchealth.com,madriverhospital.com,aslh.org,eomchospital.com,artesiageneral.com,spartahospital.com,lgh-jena.org"

Dear Trubridge,

Are you actively engaging with these comments? Could we possibly receive a more comprehensive update on the status of these ideas? We're eagerly awaiting to see the direction you take with them. Despite hearing that Dream Factory is the optimal platform for our ideas, it appears that even some of the most well-received suggestions are not gaining traction. Several highly popular concepts have been languishing on Dream Factory for over a year without significant progress being evident to your customers. This stagnation is eroding our confidence and belief that our opinions and ideas hold weight.

Multiple Product Owners and other employees are reviewing feedback and new idea submissions. As we adjust our internal processes, you should continue to see increased engagement from the Product Owners. The status of an idea will sometimes be changed without a comment. Several months ago, we improved the status options to provide a clear update on the idea's current status. You can see the description of these statuses on the Dream Factory page within TruLearn.

My provider stated this morning that he will be taking you court with him when this happens as he can't control what the EHR does and patients can't remember!!!

Would love to see this enhancement as the discharge instructions from TruBridge now are disorganized. The ability for distinction of what meds are to be continued, stopped or started would be very helpful and additionally add columns for a visual to help pt's understand when they are to take the ""continue or new"" meds such as Breakfast/Morning, Lunch, Dinner/Evening, Bedtime. Also add in this same space the date and time of the last dose of every med they rec'd in while in the hospital.


In addition, pull from the MAR the meds administered to pt's while in the ED so they know what they were given and when.

evanvelsor@springfieldhospital.org Jul 26, 2024
Yes, this would be a safer discharge med list if these were added. We have received comments from patients and physicians stating confusion when looking at the list. There is a concern for a formal complaint from patients. Please add this as soon as possible.

This causes issues at our facility over and over , causes hipaa issues too. then the only way to fix it for downstream systems and report headers is to cancel the order entirely and reorder it correctly then go fix it in all the down stream apps it may have interfaced with, this causes big issues and could cause legal issues for Facilities in the report distribution

We have struggled with this for years. Order Entry should never auto-populate a physician; staff should have to look them up and enter every time including ancillary order entry depts. Also, when nursing enters an order, the order type should never default. We have so many unsigned verbal orders that are actually written orders because that selection defaults most of the time for the nurse.","ahmchealth.com,prmc.org,stephenscountyhospital.com,fcmh.biz,gibsonhospital.org,pcmhosp.com,rch-lyons.com,dosher.org,bcmh.org,cozadhealthcare.com,yahoo.com,vhpla.com,att.net,waynehealthcare.org,prairielakes.com,bhsh.com,mhsil.com,kingmanhc.com,eomchospital.com,chomepgh.org,monroesurgical.com,wcmhosp.org,cmhcare.com,westholtmed.org"

for 2104 you added Renewal Medications displaying in yellow on the eMAR as they approach the renewal date- i would think they need to display yellow on order chronology for both the providers and nursing. the eMAR is primarily going to be nursing and the yellow is going to drive the crazy being there- was that the point LOL. My point being it can be done for this why cant it be done for IV infusion COMPLETION times.

Janna Sartin Jan 10, 2024
It needs to be more than that, maybe like if you document you started an IV that calculates as done in 1.5 hours a new administration time would pop up at that time with a way to just enter an end time. OR that the system automatically does an end time based on the calculated end time of that bag with an option for the nurse to edit it if necessary. OR Like with continuous IVF that when the next bag is charted it automatically puts in the end time of the previous bag as the time the next bag was charted with an option for the nurse to edit it as necessary.

Tabitha Clifton Mar 21, 2024
I agree with Janna Sartin on the continuous IVF with a stop time documented when a new bag is administered. Of course, it should pop up to edit. It would be nice to have these things go into like a ""work queue"" also. Like either on PDC or Alerts Tab you just go down your worklist.

Sheila Farley Mar 21, 2024
We are currently reviewing this idea to bring into development for 21.08 The initial discussion have been to do the calculations from start and hightlight the projected end time on the eMAR Please provide any additional feedback for consideration as we continue our review.

Teddy Busby May 31, 2024
This is definitely an issue that we constantly deal with at our facility. Some type of reminder or failsafe needs to be created to get these IV stop times in.

Susan Gutjahr Jul 26, 2024
With the addition of the ability to pause an IV now, the system should be able to estimate the stop time based on the medication and the rate and place a task for the nurse to document stop time. A color on the MAR to indicate a stop time is now needed is helpful as well. If a new bag is started then there should be a verification box with a stop time for the previous bag based on the start of the new bag for the nurse to verify or update as the time could essentially be incorrect.","ccmhosp.com,prmc.org,schcmed.com,fairfaxmed.com,caldwellmedical.com,pomerenehospital.org,hillsdalehospital.com,gcmc.org,raycountyhospital.com,rch-lyons.com,medinamemorial.org,rpmh.net,benefis.org,allenhealth.net,bcmh.org,jackhosp.org,bunkiegeneral.com,emhcare.net,cozadhealthcare.com,emanuelmedical.org,emailsmc.com,woodlawnhospital.com,putnamgeneral.com,tc-hs.org,pmhnet.com,gmail.com,lgh-jena.org,lifecare-health.com,cpsi.com,myfrh.com,mocohd.org,westholtmed.org,cranememorial.org,ahmchealth.com,gvhospital.org,fcmh.biz,labettehealth.com,gh-health.org,slhd.org,lchdhealthcare.org,pcmhosp.com,boydhcs.org,arkansasmethodist.org,fallonmedical.org,louisacomm.net,trigghospital.org,cahny.org,mhtcg.com,yahoo.com,grmf.org,sweetwaterhospital.org,mckenziehealth.org,nrmchealth.com,madriverhospital.com,lapazhospital.org,rayhealthcare.org,okmh.org,camernregional.org,kingmanhc.com,eomchospital.com,cullmanregional.com,artesiageneral.com,monroesurgical.com,rvmc.org,hrrmc.net,wcmhosp.org,spartahospital.com,masondistricthospital.org,girardmedicalcenter.com,evansmemorial.org,bsfmedical.com,cmhcare.com,hillsborohospital.com"

Need full provider name to display on Lab/Rad Orders

Had a case today where when registering a patient, the clerk selected the wrong provider. The last name was correct, but the first name was wrong. The error was not identified until the receiving provider called informing us that the patient didn't belong to her. Upon review, we noted that when Lab is in the order, ONLY the LAST name shows up for them. Also, when they expand the demographics, they only see the last name.

It has been very difficult to get nurses to adopt TUX navigation when they still have to go to System Menu to chart; so, they go to SM all the time. Piece meal is a killer for adopting a process.

Amanda Hillard Nov 8, 2022
Agree 1000% way to many areas..has IT trying to learn and implement all areas, and difficult to troubleshoot issues too bc you don't always know what path they are taking..the end user doesn't know the difference in Thrive, TUX, TWC..goodness!

Sabrina  Wiles Oct 10, 2023
Yes, It is a major drawback for adoption. Every time a patch is installed something has been affected negatively causing the need to instruct end users to ""just use the old one for that part"" This is crippling adoption. at this point the only way end users are going to get onboard is if they are automatically directed from the TUX icon to TWC without the option to stay in or go back to TUX.

Sheree McCommon Nov 15, 2023
The nurses on med/surg are using Web Portal and are going to System Menu >Whiteboard with their patients. The other path to patients on med/surg is through CHARTS>Tracking Board>MedSurg. Which path is the standard for nurses to use in Thrive Web Portal?

KAREN ST BLANC Dec 8, 2023
You can keep nurses from going to SM is to remove launch points on the virtual chart-neuter the VC.

Mark Boomhower Dec 8, 2023
Nurses and other clinical people are creatures of habit. The clinical workflow redesigns are truly more efficient with fewer clicks to access necessary screens, but as long as users can still access POC Whiteboard and Virtual Chart, they'll continue to do so...even if they're using TWC. I agree that designing a product which still depends on older program options and needs ""Thrive Helper"" is self defeating and adds to the complexity rather than improving efficiency.

Stephanie St. Andrie Dec 13, 2023
Sheree, The preferred path is to have nurses use the Track Board in Web Client to access their patients. The Tracking Board has a My Patients option along with test results, order notifications, and additional notifications being developed. There should be no need for nurses to go to System Menu to the WhiteBoard any longer.

Stephanie St. Andrie Dec 13, 2023
We could look at making a change that allows sites to turn off the System Menu option in the application drawer. Maybe by role so nursing would be forced to stay in Web Client but others that still needed to go between platforms could do so until we eliminate the need?

KAREN ST BLANC Dec 13, 2023
If you take away the launch points on each hart tab on the Virtual Chart, when a nurse goes to SM, there is nothing to access.

This quote was copied from the admin response on DFE-I-169 that was merged with this idea:

""The Thrive/Thrive UX desktop application only needs to be installed on devices for users whose full workflow has not yet been elevated to Web Client System Menu. At this time, this would include roles such as HIM/Registration, Ancillary, and System Administrators. "" I need Evident to know that, if they want any sort of full adoption with COMMUNICATION CENTER, they either have to get the users mentioned in the departments above FULLY ON THE TWC, or CREATE A POP-UP ALERT for COMMUNICATION CENTER for the users still on TUX, that would only use TWC to log in with (as Evident recommends for these departments not fully integrated in TWC). I say this because MULTIPLE items in the SAFER Guide Clinical assessment CLINICAL COMMUNICATION directly points to the Communication Center's capabilities, which would be fantastic, if all users in the hospital setting could actually be alerted there are messages, faxes, texts for them while working in TUX. As it stands right now, because of the lack of a fully integrated, fully functional, singular platform, using COMMUNICATION CENTER IS THE OPPOSITE OF SAFE CLINICAL PRACTICES. This is a great example of why improvements that are rolled out as separate platforms are not improvements but interruptions in workflow and difficult to adopt. I have been waiting for the fully functional version of TWC to be available before I roll out Communication Center...it's been 2 years.","alhnet.org,surgeonschoice.com,ahmchealth.com,prmc.org,caldwellmedical.com,labettehealth.com,gibsonhospital.org,rch-lyons.com,fallonmedical.org,tsjh.org,jchealthcare.com,cameronregional.org,allenhealth.net,bunkiegeneral.com,osshealth.com,keefemh.org,cahny.org,yahoo.com,grmf.org,vhpla.com,att.net,dalemedical.org,bhsh.com,woodlawnhospital.com,mckenziehealth.org,ajmchc.org,tchospital.us,okmh.org,aslh.org,kingmanhc.com,eomchospital.com,kchc.net,chomepgh.org,artesiageneral.com,monroesurgical.com,wcmhosp.org,gmail.com,lgh-jena.org,mclaren.org,electrahospital.com,pchd.net,cmhcare.com,westholtmed.org,itinspired.com,franklinfoundation.org"

I would say this isn't a ""nice to know"".......I would say this is a shame on CPSI for not having already completed this assessment. I work in a health system and our sister hospital uses Meditech. Meditech provided a complete assessment of their software against these standard in a detailed manner. This includes specific information on how the software needed to be utlized to achieve the results. Instead every time I have a few minutes to work on this survey, I have to write out all of my questions, send them to our CSM and then our CSM sends them out to the managers of these departments and I have to wait for their response. Not happy at all with this process. CPSI-do the right thing and complete this assessment! The outcome should be incorporated into the company roadmap going forward for all new development.

Patients are wanting their information now without having to wait. This is especially true if someone is traveling and has a car wreck.

Good Morning Robert, when you ask for the ability to disable 'create a note' for your users do you want them to have view-only access to the Notes application? If that is the case we currently have a few behavior controls that you may be interested in. The first BC is Note Viewing Access which allows the user to view only notes within the Note List panel. The other is Note Creation Access which allows the user the ability to Create a Note. In the Notes User Guide (https://userareas.cpsi.com/userareas/files/user_guides/Notes.pdf) , there is a chapter on security that also shows the default roles these are applied to. If you do not want the user to Create a note you could set up a deny rule for Create a Note if that user is part of a role that has that as a default.

kimberly hennigan Oct 5, 2023
Not Robert, but we don't want to disable our hospital nurses' ability to create a note (though we've discussed it), we just don't want them to automatically get the ""create a note"" panel when they navigate to the notes tab. They might have to create a note on occasion, but the vast majority of the time when they go to the Notes tab they want the Note List. When the tab automatically takes them to the create note pane, it takes time to dismiss since Notes is one of the slower tabs to load, and they also run the risk of inadvertently creating a new note. It scares some of them. We've talked about taking away their create note access but don't want to do that because our daycare uses Notes for charting and sometimes our hospital nurses float to the daycare.

Mary Ruckart Oct 5, 2023
So you want more of a sticky functionality. If the user moves the Note list Panel first, it should stay there so that is what displays first when you open Notes?

kimberly hennigan Oct 5, 2023
From my perspective, no. I would set the default for everyone as Note List.

Sticky functions are nice when you tend to do the same thing on a screen over and over but when you use multiple options on a screen it can be confusing because if users aren't paying attention it seems like they randomly start in different spots each time they go to a chart tab. So making it sticky would be nice for the people who never/rarely create notes but for users who do create notes it will seem like sometimes they get the Create Note pane and sometimes they get the Note List.

If you think about it, most users are going to the Note List. Even users who create notes are going to typically spend more time reading notes than creating a note and will usually read notes first. Taking you to the Note List first with a readily available button for creating a note also mimics how other systems that users might be familiar with are set up.

I'd make the Create Note button more visible or move it. I personally like where it is now but those who create a lot of notes would probably want it more to the right so they don't have to move the mouse as much to click on it. I'd suggest moving that entire line of buttons (create note/note list/template library/phrases) over to the right.

From sitting with a bunch of providers and showing them how Notes works, most of them are at least mildly annoyed that the system automatically thinks they want to create a note. They want that to be more of a deliberate action rather than the default.","jchealthcare.com,wahiawageneral.org,woodlawnhospital.com,lgh-jena.org,chomepgh.org"

I'd like to stress how important this is from a user management standpoint. ESPECIALLY WITH COMMUNICATION CENTER FUNCTIONALITY!!!! There is only 1 of me in my facility, so no one else knows or feels my pain of user management, so I can see how this idea will never tally a lot of votes like other ideas. Those of us at the USER MANAGEMENT level REALLY need you to see this and the comments.


From a management standpoint in and now in CONSOLE for pushing boards, FAXING in COMMUNICATION CENTER, this would make it SO MUCH EASIER to build the GROUPS. Interestingly enough, it works in the MESSAGING part of COMMUNICATION CENTER, but not FAXING.


From a user managment view, a description of the user or their department next to their username that would NOT pull into reports is very handy. It's a quick way to glance at the user list and know if they need to be audited, such as do they still need to be active in the system. Currently I add their description such as ""travel nurse"" to their last name, but that is pulling to medication reports. But it makes it easy to track if they are active or not, since they come and go on contracts, work nights, and no one knows their names. Laura",kchc.net,"Nikki Csiki Sep 19, 2022
This would be very useful indeed. Our facility has nursing and medical students, medical residents, contractors, etc. and it would be quite helpful to easily identify them.

Russ Taylor Oct 6, 2022
yes, I've often wished there was another field we could use to put in a description or note for every user, but, like comment below, for our students especially.

Laura Colbert Jun 16, 2023
So as I continue to expand our use of Thrive, I find this description would be REALLY handy. For example, setting up groups in the Faxing of Communication Center. I have already added descriptions to my users in the ""Display Name"" field. This should come in handy for searching users to add them to the ""Lab"" faxing group. BUT, the search function must not pull from this field, as I am unable to search by ""Lab"" and have to search by either first or last name. This makes adding users to a fax group very cumbersome, as you have to know the user's name, not just their department. And users are typically grouped by department when it comes to fax numbers. I really hope that even without votes, this gets someone's attention. There are lot more supervisors and end users in facilities than security folks like me, so we'll never garner the amount of votes like other ideas. This would be HUGE for us that manage the users.

Laura Colbert Jul 5, 2023
I'm also finding this would be helpful in building groups and security in the Communication Center!!

I agree, I to am the only one at my facility in this roll. User management seems to be a forgotten roll when it comes to improving the flow.

We too would like to see a better 1-2 page document that can be generated to give the patient leaving the clinic discharge instructions. We are using the Discharge Summary CCD but it is several pages long and contains sections not pertinent to the patient. At a minimum, if we could hide entire sections of the Discharge Summary CCD, it would be shorter and more pertinent for the patient. And we need to be able to filter how what some of the sections pull such as active meds/problems and not all. We then have included a Plan section in the provider Note titled Patient Discharge Instructions that pulls to the CCD Plan sections. This is definitely an area that could use some immediate love. Our insurance carrier mandates that we provide discharge instructions and it is currently a very inefficient process which leaves room for error and could present a patient safety issue.

Hey Folks. I am not sure if you guys have used or are familiar with ExitCare that was the Diagnosis Specific discharge instructions platform in Centriq, but it was so easy to use, was laid out nicely on the screen, was easily read and understood by patients, and almost NEVER had a diagnosis that was not available (maybe we had 2 in the 8 years we were on Centriq). I have a Dream Factory Idea for sites to be able to use ExitCare over the (frustrating) MicroMedex that currently provides Diagnosis-Specific discharge instructions in Thrive. MicroMedex is lacking in documents and diagnoses even when you follow the proper route to search for them and lacking instructions for many ICD 10 codes. Both ExitCare and MicroMedex are third parties, so it makes sense that we should be able to use ExitCare in Thrive. Please go vote for this idea for a much better platform that provides Discharge-specific Patient Education Documents. Thanks!

The main issue we have is that when we incomplete the second isolate, the first isolate is now REPLACED with the second isolate and the health care providers now only see the second isolate until the microbiologist is able to go back into the analyzer to manually resubmit both cultures at the same time.

Due to only having one microbiologist on staff, the microbiologist is unable to continuously review isolates to catch these inconsistencies. As a result, the inaccurate results provided to the healthcare providers have cause confusion and can negatively affect antibiotic treatment choices.

The addition of an ADD function to the microbiology list of functions would allow for multiple cultures to be reported at the same time without requiring going into the analyzer to resubmit all resulted cultures simultaneously.

1. Microbiologist must select one of these functions to proceed. REPLACE function is selected. If there was an ADD function, the first culture results wont be replaced with the second culture results is available.
2. After selecting REPLACE, microbiologist can now review and select INCOMPLETE while awaiting the second culture results and repeats the same steps again.

I hope this explains the situation. The reporting of incomplete microbiology results to the healthcare providers has been problematic for us and the addition of the ADD function would truly help alleviate this issue that has been ongoing at our facility.

Alternatively, Order Sets may be set up with the exact number of times and frequency desired from the Start Date/Time entered during OE.

Nikki Csiki Oct 31, 2023
Hi Michelle,

You can set up frequencies and number of tests/duration, but the issue is it does not work correctly. Lab gets no notification of subsequent draws, clinicians cannot readily see the details of the order from order chron (no stop date or number of draws on the order), order chron does not not show how many of x draws have been completed, only the first one displays and the order says ""completed"" even though outstanding draws still exist.

Chris Gabel Nov 14, 2023
I have tried to edit an order set for bedside glucoses. There are frequencies you can select from, such as QID but the times are not exactly as I'd like. These seem to be built differently from pharmacy frequencies and I can't figure out where to build these. Also adding a frequency should be for all ancillary departments - like radiology - for example daily EKGs. Nursing orders too - daily weights. Also agree with other dream factory ideas for being able to pre-add reasons for PRN meds and antibiotics in order sets. For example, in the Pneumonia Order set, one could pre-fill in ""pneumonia"" for the antibiotic or ""fever"" for the Tylenol order. This was possible in order building in Centriq so I know that it is a possibility. I would say in general, order set building is easier in Thrive than Centriq but would love to see the best of both together!

Bedside glucose is a horse of a different color as we have options on the MAR for that one. I do see your point and appreciate the feedback.

Michelle, Is there a setting in tables that allows a frequency for items? I do not have the option to edit an ancillary item for frequency.

Karen, for lab tests, it has to be ""allowed"" individually for each test in where the lab tests are built in System Menu - Charge Table-Inventory etc under OE Ask frequency.

Michelle Mason Nov 14, 2023
Chris is correct. It is per item.

Chris Gabel Nov 15, 2023
Michelle I did try to add a frequency to a lab test in Order Set Building and there is no place to put a duration while building. This can be corrected while actually ordering, but I can confidently say no doctor is going to go into each lab test and add a duration while placing orders. See the screenshot.

Workflow wise, it would make more sense for them to show in Notes since Physdoc is going away sometime in the future.",sphosp.org,"Donna Halmans May 18, 2023
This has been a huge deal to physicians at my facility. There are still a large number of physicians who prefer to dictate their notes. The problem with putting them into the Notes is that a physician then has to open each note, edit and then resign the note to get the transcriptionists name off as being the author of the note. Whether a note is entered in via Notes or Transcription System should not matter and they should all be able to be seen in the Note List in Notes. Centriq was able to have all the provider notes together in Notes List. They also should all be able to be seen under Documentation in Clinic History instead of having to click on MR and then have to filter through everything that is under MR.

adalton@caldwellmedical.com Jun 8, 2023
This would be great! Since moving from Centriq to Thrive, our provider feel that they don't see the ""whole"" picture. Clinical History is honestly so full of data, it is not good to use as a daily part of the workflow.

Nicholas Dunn Aug 19, 2023
Please also add any Phys Docs to Notes view pane as well. We need providers to be able to view any other provider documentation. This includes Transcriptions, Notes, Phys Docs, etc. Currently this is just one more place where users must know to go somewhere else in the system to get information that makes sense to be in one pane.

Linda Pfeifle Sep 13, 2023
Transcriptions need to show in notes. A transcription is very important and I think a lot of people miss seeing them as they are so used to looking in Notes and they forget all about the transcription tab. There are staff members who don't know who dictates and who doesn't and it leads them to miss information in the chart.

Donna Halmans Oct 5, 2023
This is still a huge problem. Transcription system entered provider notes need to either be loaded into the Notes system or at the very least be linked to Documentation in Clinical History so it is easier and faster to locate provider dictation. When it comes down to it, DOCUMENTAITON, no matter how a provider chooses to do so, should be TOGETHER in a chart.

Chris Gabel Oct 5, 2023
Agree. We have angry docs who can't find transcriptions on past visits as they move from transcriptions after so many days.

Susan Stevens Oct 19, 2023
This is definitely a huge issue with providers but also with any other staff who need to find documentation on our patients. I would argue that this can become a patient care issue and has potential for causing harm due to the ability to miss important information if transcribed and manual creation of notes is not in one area. Just my opinion, but I stand by it.

Chason Hicks Jul 23, 2024
Thank you for the suggestion @guest. Just to take it a step further, are the providers looking to be able to look at any and all types of documents/files/scans/images/transcriptions/etc directly from the Notes application? Or does this request primarily come up with transcriptions?

Donna Halmans Jul 23, 2024
I know that our providers would just like to see all provider documentation in one spot. Anything that is scanned in, labs, images, etc. should stay in their areas that they are in. When a patient is seen by a provider that dictates which then the note is entered into the transcription system and then the patient is seen by a provider that uses the Notes system; it takes a lot for a provider to find all the notes and make sure nothing is being missed since the documentation is not put together.

Chris Gabel Jul 23, 2024
I agree it's mainly transcriptions. I think adding all the images etc, would make it too hard to sort through all the information. What the docs really want is to see the other providers have documented.

When a patient is discharged sometimes the Hospitalist desires to direct a patient hold a med until they can follow-up with their PCP. This happens in the ED as well. Hold would keep the med on the patient Home med list. Ideally it would indicate it is on hold. When the patient followed up with their PCP they could then reconcile the patient to continue or discontinue the med. If the Hospitalist discontinues the med then it falls off the patient home med list which is not desirable. We would also use this when a patient goes to surgery to Hold all active meds. We would then like an action to Resume all active meds when the patient returns which reactivates the prior CPOE order. Today we have to use CPOE as the desintation and are essentially reordering the active meds which is unnecessary in many instances. Held meds should show on the MAR as held and in order Chron as held.

We mulled over the options for notification of reassessment. The option of having the medication turn Orange on the MAR for overdue med response was not a good option. You would have to go into each medication's item master to indicate for the overdue med response. After a med was given, you would have to go into every patient's MAR to see if there was any med highlighted orange. we chose to use the location option for timed tasks. In Exam room table maintenance in BOTM, we created several options: Oral pain med reassessment, IV/IM pain med reassessment, gastroview, etc. Having the timer counting up and the color change on the whiteboard in POC, all nurses can see if and when the patient needs reassessed.

Beth Adams Mar 6, 2024
Hi, everyone. I wanted to touch base on this to summarize developments, issues, corrections etc.

A brief history: When the Radiology card was first developed for PDC, there was a limitation to what it could display for transcriptions. In the event a Rad order has a scanned image, it could not display both the Thrive ""transcription"" (see scanned report) and the scanned image itself. It was supposed to display the scanned image since the majority of the time, that is where the crucial information would be. There were some bumps in the road where it would randomly show the scanned image on one order and the Thrive transcription on another order.

Skip to today: After much testing of the various scenarios, it was determined the best way to make sure all pertinent information is available, it was decided a slide deck would be put in place so the user could use arrows to scroll through all documents on the order. This change went out on PDC_1.7.0.f1 via a hotfix. In doing so, a particular document type was inadvertently removed which affects how ""text"" type transcriptions are displayed. That is why some sites are having issues seeing a paperclip and some are not. If you have interfaced ""text"" type transcriptions, they will not display in PDC at this time. The fix will be sent out soon, but some other migrations have to be completed before the PDC version can be updated. Once it's fixed, users will still have the arrows for orders with multiple documents as well as the paperclip for text type transcriptions. Interfaced rtf transcriptions have not been affected.

Beth Adams Mar 6, 2024
Sara, I added a larger comment above, but wanted to let you know, the issue is with the transcription type y'all use which is what was corrected. As soon as we can get the fix implemented, we will certainly do so because we are aware of what a pain this is.","vmhospital.com,cozadhealthcare.com,pchsgrant.com,madriverhospital.com,lgh-jena.org,surgeonschoice.com"

""Create New Visit"" in Charts & Scheduling needs to default to the same programing that is in ""Create New Visit"" in System Menu's Person Profile. Then another button needs to be created for ""Create Temp Visit"" and also match what is available in System Menu's Temporary Registration. Then this needs to be made available within all the areas within Chart lookup result option to Create New Visit. TPEHR, EDIS, & Nursing Tracking Board).

Glad to see ""Violent Behavior"" added. The problem is that this alert only stays within that single encounter. Any patient with a ""history of violence"" should cross from chart to chart like allergies and MRSA. Adding a notation AFTER a staff member or another pt is assaulted, is much too late. Currently you are relying on staff memory and extensive chart review to add that notation proactively. Continue with the ability to initiate and remove via radio button. Just continue through each stay. This is a safety issue, not sure how this is prioritized, but this feature should be addressed.

Thanks for the reply! Does the data in this card have the ability to be inserted into a Note?

They want the ability to choose what result displays in their note from any date/time, for example: K+ result from the day before to the most recent, a Hgb trend, but also just the most recent Hct result and most recent chem7 panel - all in one list.

So you cant insert what you pick in PDC to notes but you can also create custom filter in notes. You could narrow down the labs filter to what a doc would want to see. But this isn't really an on the fly functionality. This would need to created so they can insert it. If this is not something you guys are currently using I would encourage you to review the Filter Toolbox (https://cpsi.docebosaas.com/learn/courses/2093/thrive-filter-toolbox) course in CPSIQ on the Notes (https://cpsi.docebosaas.com/pages/204/thrive-notes) page.

We have created custom lab filters in Notes, but the providers expressed that they are too lengthy and are limited in what they want to include in their note. We offered to create custom filters per the providers' preference, but it was pointed out that the results they want to include depends on the patient's case day to day.

There are general labs that are usually ordered for each patient daily - for example, CBC panel and Chem panel. However, for one patient, the provider would just want to include the Hgb trend in their note, but for another patient they would want to show a K+ trend and a full cbc panel. The next day, the provider does not want to include those results, and instead wants to focus on the troponin trend since admission in the note. The providers feel that the filters are not efficient in giving them the ability to display what results are significant to the each patient's case each day in their note templates.","ahmchealth.com,tcmh.org,caldwellmedical.com,gibsonhospital.org,madriverhospital.com,iberiamedicalcenter.com"

For any interested, if you contact Dragon Medical One(Nuance) Support directly they may be able to help you with this issue by installing the latest build of Dragon and putting you on a Basic Text control.

The text box always opens and the text will not always transfer or will only transfer partially. Additionally, only when using Dragon with Evident (works in our other applications, EMRs, and Word without any problem at all) text that was previously dictated, sent to the application, and cleared from the text box will populate again when the user tries to add additional information. The problems exist in TUX as well, but at least there the user can manually push the dictation box contents to a note. We have tried using the basic text control option in Dragon and it does not remove the text box pop at all for us. This really, really needs to be correct.

The issue is that the allergies are still searchable by name without the ""CONTRAST"" addition and are often added that way, for example, iodine. Additionally, if the user searches ""iodine"" the option to select the ""CONTRAST"" version does not even appear. I have added an attachment. Lastly, many people that are allergic to iodine have never had a contrast radiology study, so there is no possible way to know if they are actually allergic to the contrast. Radiology staff, however, still need to have the red alert for this so that they can take precautions as needed for the patient. Iodine is just an example, but it is the same for other contrast media as well. This is an ENORMOUS patient safety issue and we have brought it to Evident's attention many times.

DFE-I-459,Please connect coding activity to the patient Problem List,"TruBridge EHR - Clinical,TruBridge EHR - Financial",Default (Unassigned),Product Owner Review,2023-01-12 18:14:48,25,,"Providers do not keep up on the Problem List (of course we try to enforce this but it is a loosing battle). Our coders add problems via their documentation into the record, but there is no communication to the Problem List. At the least the primary diagnosis should add to the problem list after being coded. The other issue is that dates and status are not required fields and they are constantly left blank. Correct and up to date information is so important for continuity of care. Finally, problems imported from CCDA documents do not carry in status, date OR provider, all very important; in hospital, I cannot possible know dates or providers from the outpatient setting.

I have included an attachment showing coded diagnoses and problem list for a (the same) patient (no identifiers included). It is pretty relevant to future care for clinicians to know the patient was diagnosed with acute gastritis with bleeding and the date vs the descriptive problems of RUQ pain, nausea, diarrhea, and chronic cholecystitis from the problem list.",gibsonhospital.org,"Donna Halmans Dec 15, 2023
There are a lot of other problems with the Problem List other than the above. If something was entered in error it should just be off of a patient's list all together and not show up when All Problems is selected. The biggest problem is when a provider actually does try to put in a dx. They seldom pick the correct code which then has to be marked entered in error and then the correct code is put in by the coder. The description on some of these codes is way off. Example: Provider put in description painful enlarged lymph nodes and gets a choice to pick R52, pain unspecified, which will not cover the US of the lymph nodes. Through query, provider wanted R59.0 localized enlarged lymph nodes. The description lists can be long and providers do not pay attention to what code they are choosing. It would be best to just allow them to free type a diagnosis and let the coders choose the codes. That is another whole issue on its own.

But dates and taking off entered in error off the charts is a big thing!

TRESA BOYD Jan 31, 2024
Agree there are a lot of issues with the Problem List. If something is on the Problem List and that code expires, nothing stops anyone from still attaching said problem to an account after it was expired. And using descriptions to select problems poses the issue of having multiple ""descriptions"" having the exact same ICD10 code... causing claims to deny.

I spent a lot of my day today trying to figure out how a physician entered a radiology order. Since my hospital won't give me the go ahead and ""hid"" their TUX icon this physician uses what he wants depending on the day. So after talking circles with support and then running 2 report dashboard reports, thats where I finally found that he entered the order remotely through TWC and that there is an open known issue with radiology and notification from TWC to radiology after the order has been verified by nursing- but that took up a lot of my day just to get to that point.

Healthland had a great order detail audit. I will include a test order for IVF just for reference. It would be great if you would talk to some of your Healthland people to get more information.

Thank you for sharing. Between the Order Detail and Order History screen in Thrive, most of the information listed in the attachment is present. Is it more important that you are able to extract it in a report format?

Linda Pfeifle Nov 7, 2023
It is nice as a report, but I think it is nice to see it on the order so you can see what you need right there. The details that Healthland shows is way more detailed than what Thrive shows. Thrive does not show what the original value was and what it was changed to because it doesn't even have that functionality which it needs to have - such as changing times, using home meds, etc. Healthland's also shows a reason why an order was discontinued which Thrive doesn't even have.

Could you please provide more information on how this is causing med errors? The Ordered Medication List was only intended to display the ordered medication description in a list format. The Ordered Meds Table will display the information you need in a table format. The List is intended to be the abbreviated version. If the above information is needed to display in the note, users should be using that table over the list. A template may also be prebuilt with the table so they do not need to select the Ordered Med List from the filter list. As well as a custom filter may be built that displays the above information in a list format and has that prebuilt into the template if they like the look of the list format. Using the medication filters was never intended as place to give medications.

Maryanne B Oct 4, 2023
Hi Mary,

This idea was submitted due to a concern from providers that when a provider places this filter into their note and the patient is discharged to another facility, the facility would use the note to reconcile the patient's medications and enter an incorrect dosage. We notified our providers to not use this filter and tried to replace the filter from the templates as best we could, but we would like a way to either prevent them from using it (hiding from default) or having it to include the dosage and be complete.

Mary Ruckart Oct 4, 2023
Well, hopefully patients transferred are using the CCDA for that information. I am going to edit your idea to just say you would like the ability to hide Thrive default filters within Notes. Create the ability for the facility to be able to pick what filters users may us in their templates. Does that work for you?

Sarah Blazier Jul 28, 2023
If all medications had an option to attach a specific type of assessment category that may be user defined. Example: pain medication - select assessment and the option would be related to pain such as 0-10 scale, location, intensity if applicable. But if it is a neb treatment the options would be Resp, HR, O2sat, tolerates well, etc. It would save double documentation being done in the flowchart and save extra step for nursing.

Linda Pfeifle Jan 4, 2024
That would be a wonderful idea to attach an assessment or maybe a flowchart to a medication and/or any other order that would require that kind of documentation.

Theresa Golden Jan 24, 2024
More details and options are definitely needed on the assessment screen. The documentation on the assessment was not sufficient for our state survey because of the character limit and number of options. Staff documents assessment against the med and the assessment comments were adjust to direct them back to the flow chart for detail so that there is adequate documentation of the assessment.

Sabrina  Wiles Mar 14, 2024
This is a great idea in addition to having the Pain Scale ___/10 there should be a blank for the location and/or intensity of the pain. It could be a list of body locations or a free text blank.

Lexie Tulak Jul 12, 2024
If we could have a screen like the PCA assessment portion in the mar for other medications that would be incredible!! That way we could chart pain assessment and reassessment with more detail on the MAR

The following is needed to make this an effective tool:

1) the order set name needs to be included in the header for the order set.You can't tell which order set you are looking out without investigation into the content.

2) The orders/headers need to be reported in the same order as they are built in the order set. If a header belongs to a set of orders it needs to display in that manner. It is not helpful at all to have all of the headers listed together. Respect the order.

3) There needs to be an option for a page break between order sets.

4) There should be an option to select ONLY the order sets you want in the report.....currently is all or nothing.

I agree 100% plus the report should pull the long description. You may have a nursing order that is VS Q4 but your long description is VS Q4 while away as well as when creating medication orders. The item master may say Morhpine 4 mg because thats the size vial we carry but the set up is actually for Morphine 2 mg PRN Q4 for Pain 8-10. This is all in the long description and not shown on the report at all. You have to then go into to each line to see what it is actually set up.

In additional to the changes requested above, add a column for Last Date Used. This will aid admin staff when reviewing Sets/Lists/Protocols to see unused items that could be removed or made inactive.

Bahati Ayugi Mar 19, 2024
Also, we should be able to print order sets. There should be options to print individual sets - individual sets or all sets for a certain provider, etc... It is unacceptable that with today's technology, we are forced to take screenshots of each page to get order details.

Then, if a user attempts to take any action, the EHR prompts them to enter their credentials to continue.

I think this would be beneficial for CPSI, too. Oftentimes, CPSI users will stay logged in only to keep an eye out for incoming status updates for orders. If that logged in user walks away from the computer without logging out, it's not unusual for a different user to continue using that session (not ideal, I know, but it's a reality that we'll perpetually be addressing via education).

DFE-I-513,IMPORTED VITAL SIGNS NEED TO INCLUDE MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE (MAP),"Interface,Vital Signs",Default (Unassigned),Open for Comment,2023-02-10 18:25:06,15,,"Currently if a blood pressure is documented manually by nursing staff in the VS application, the MAP is auto calculated once the systolic and diastolic pressures have been entered. When they're imported from a monitor system (like Mindray), only the systolic and diastolic pressures appear even though the HL7 message contains the MAP value. The programming / logic used in the VS application needs to be updated so it recognizes the mean arterial pressures being imported with the rest of the VS. When providers enter orders for Hemodynamic drugs such as Norepinephrine using an infusion protocol, the order will state the parameters. For example, ""Norepinephrine drip, start at 2mcg/min and titrate every 2-5 minutes to desired mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 - 65"". Documenting this correctly would be greatly improved if the VS imported appear accurately in the EMR. On hectic nursing units in stressful situations, remembering to enter all of the B/P's manually so the MAP is captured is easily overlooked.",artesiageneral.com,"dnewby@prmc.org Feb 24, 2023
We also previously submitted this request back in September. DFE-I-285. It's a real aggravation for nursing that it only calculates for manually entered vitals even though it's on the interface.

kimberly hennigan Apr 15, 2023
In addition, for those of us who do not have a monitor interface, we need to be able to manually enter MAP instead of having it calculated. There should be a setting where we can turn off the calculated MAP.

Most (maybe all) NIBPs measure MAP and calculate systolic/diastolic based off an algorithm. Often the measured and calculated MAPs match, but not always. It is disturbing to know that clinical decisions are made based off a number that might not be accurate.

Please add CO2 while you are at it. I have a separate Dream Factory idea for this but I'm not going to miss an opportunity to suggest this..

I thought I might talk with someone at the CAC meeting, but I forgot about it until now. I would like to have the patient names added to the Patient Audit Log with User Name report in the Report Dashboard. I have asked over the years, and have been told that it will not be added. When we are running HIPAA audits, this is a piece of information that is needed to review patient record access with the employee that we are investigating. Without the patient names, I have to go into each account, find the patient name, and add it to the spreadsheet. So, now it shows that I have searched for the patient, and my name is attached to looking at the visit when I really didn't and it's very time consuming. I'm not sure the reason that we cannot get a report with the patient name, but I pull plenty of other ad hoac and Report Dashboard reports that include patient names. This just doesn't make sense to me. Thank you. Grady",evident.com,"Susan Stevens Sep 13, 2023
Adding this to all HIPAA audit ideas I come across: To expound upon this further, I feel the ""descriptors"" of the path users are taking which could also then be clicked on to take you directly to the specific patient and document or area accessed. It is very difficult to complete a comprehensive review of an audit trail when the naming conventions don't really tell you anything. Example, and I apologize for the comparison to Centriq: Ability to have a drop down that not only covers a specific date range, but also additional dropdowns for search of specified user (both actual name and username), drop down with search for patient names, drop down with search for specific area of chart such as Notes, Lab, Documents and ability to search from dropdown for service type (IP, ER, OP, etc.). After that point, the ability to click on the ""Note"" and it will bring up the exact note a user had accessed.

The O2 liter flow/FiO2 value affects many things from reimbursement to patient transfers. For example, the patient's status can be completely different when their O2 Sat is 90% on room air vs 90% on 5L/min of O2. Receiving facilities will need to know this to decide where the patient should be placed such as MedSurg, ICU, etc. Insurance companies will look at the vital signs to help determine justification for reimbursement for the patient hospital stay. Also, many situations for chart audits/reviews are: if it wasn't documented, it didn't happen. It may seem like a small thing, but it has a huge impact.

Example, and I apologize for the comparison to Centriq: Ability to have a drop down that not only covers a specific date range, but also additional dropdowns for search of specified user (both actual name and username), drop down with search for patient names, drop down with search for specific area of chart such as Notes, Lab, Documents and ability to search from dropdown for service type (IP, ER, OP, etc.).

We had an issue that led to a misunderstanding because the nurse initials were ""PM"". The day shift nurse had to call the previous nurse at home to verify what time doses were actually given; as the night nurse missed the midnight dose. Then documented the midnight dose at 0539 as given, Omitted the 0600 dose at 0540...and for some reason went on to document that she gave the 1200 dose at 0545. In actuality, she only gave 1 of the doses. With her initials displaying as PM (AM would be the same way) made the issue even more confusing to view. If initials are consistently displayed as FIRST, MIDDLE AND LAST throughout TUX and TWC; misunderstandings like this would be avoided. See attached screenshot.",artesiageneral.com,"Stephanie St. Andrie Jun 2, 2023
adding the middle initial to the payroll field in Thrive or the Employee Setup/Maintenance field so it pulls to the eMAR is what you need to do. Here is some helpful info about where initials and employee names pull from now:

* initials on the eMAR grid pull from initials field on pg 1 of payroll or from Employee Setup/Maintenance if they don't use Thrive payroll
* order detail pulls from POC reports field in payroll (page 3 of emp info)
* Medication report pulls name from System admin and then it pulls the credentials listed after the name from the Credentials field in Payroll (page 3 of emp info) or if they don't use Thrive payroll then Credentials will have to be added to the Name field through Employee Setup/Maintenance

Cassi Loutzenhiser Dec 27, 2023
We have multiple employees who have the same exact 3 initials so pulling initials only is a very bad practice. I can understand in some screens that only initials show but it's really not safe/smart. All 3 initials and credentials would be better but still we have 2 different CNAs with same exact initials so this isn't helpful either. You should have full name and credentials on all nursing documentation whether it be EMAR or Flowcharts. Also POC Reports field is way too short to do full name or initials and credentials so that's bad as well. You definitely need a better and more uniform way to show who documented what as I'm constantly playing the who's initials are these game between lab, xray, nurses, cnas, pharmacists, & providers.","prmc.org,rch-lyons.com,artesiageneral.com"

Are you actively engaging with these comments? Could we possibly receive a more comprehensive update on the status of these ideas? We're eagerly awaiting to see the direction you take with them. Despite hearing that Dream Factory is the optimal platform for our ideas, it appears that even some of the most well-received suggestions are not gaining traction.

This stagnation is eroding our confidence and belief that our opinions and ideas hold weight.

Angela Plummer Oct 30, 2023
We can't get our Providers to switch to TP-EHR, they really dislike the EHR they have now, but the only advantage is that it has is they can select a diagnosis within their Note and place orders from it and it all will populate to their Note per diagnosis. I think they would just be happy to to see their orders within their Notes auto-populating (capturing order chronology, at least this is my version of that) and as for radiology, they don't want to have to leave the Note to have to filter something in, it'll just be faster to voice dictate it into their Note. To much in and out of Notes when you are working with a laptop, time is a virtue & as I am sure you have heard because I have heard it a million times...... provider burnout- and I am the miracle worker to fix this ;)

Michelle Mason Oct 30, 2023
Thank you for the clarification. The ideal workflow would be to complete ""all the things"" before opening the Note - reviewing Console for Rad Results and sending to a new Note (or just copying to paste into your note), making sure Vitals are updated, updating which Problems are being treated this visit, reviewing labs, placing orders, etc. Then, open the Note so see those things filtered in and personalize/finalize the Note.

There are filters for Orders (look for new options coming in the next Notes update) that can pull orders in. Make sure you sign up for the Evident Briefing to hear more about the new Notes features.

Kelsey Drouhard Oct 31, 2023
Michelle,

Can you send me the info on how this can be done? I put in a situation not too long ago asking and they said it could not pull in the transcription so I am a little confused.

Linda Pfeifle Oct 31, 2023
This would be a lot easier if there was just a filter on notes to bring these things in. the providers don't want to have to go to other places. They want to be able to access everything from 1 spot.

KAREN ST BLANC Oct 31, 2023
In PhysDoc we had providers pull their discharge orders into the Discharge Summary and lost the functionality with Notes; a filter would be great to have to pull the discharge orders into the Discharge Summary. Our providers clean up order chron and put in their discharge orders, perform a Discharge MedRec, and then do their Discharge Summary in Notes; a discharge orders filter would be awesome.

Radiology reports pulling into notes would be great since the providers pull lab results into Notes.

KAREN ST BLANC Oct 31, 2023
A filter to pull any orders into the Note from Order Chron would be great.

Make sure you have the Radiology filter in your Note. The Radiology filter may be inserted into a template, or a create note field, to allow the information from the Radiology Card within Patient Data Console to insert into the filter. Notes will display the Radiology text where the Radiology filter was placed in the template.

It would be good if there was not a ""new"" button option in the registration area at all. We try to get the clerks to enter all 9s which defaults to our facility name with a new physician or one they can't find. When medical records runs the daily census and gets the information they will go in and enter the physician in the table and correct the account but the clerks sometimes forget to do this and the table is left in a mess.

It would also be nice if the physician table and referring physician tables were just one table that would capture everything rather than maintaining 2 different tables.

Kenneth  Langworthy Mar 4, 2024
Our physicians have brought up issues with alerts as well. Once acknowledged, the alert is 'gone'. If an incorrect alert was acknowledged or the physician wants to go back and look at past alerts, there is no recourse. They were looking for a way to see these.

Here is the idea:
Retain the alerts somewhere in the system. Call it the Alerts Retention Well. The alerts stay in the Well until they are deleted.
Create Alerts rules.
Have ability to create facility alert retention rules, roles based retention rules, and UBL retention rules.

EX:

Control = rule retention
Facility =
Role =
UBL = allow multiple UBLs
Line for delete alerts ______ days post discharge.

This way I can have a facility rule of delete after 15 days post discharge.
I can have a physician role rule for delete after 20 days post discharge.
I can have a UBL specific rule to delete Dr. Kenneth's after 45 days.

While the rules reside in the Well, have a screen so that folks can review acknowledged alerts. The alerts stay in the Well until deleted by the Alerts Rules outline above.

Of course, facility rule is for everyone unless they have a role rule. The role rule would be overridden by the UBL specific rule.

That's a nice thought, but it is not finite data that can be gathered. That turns the data gathering into a manual process.

Hi Susie, once a patient is discharged they will fall off of the tracking board with the exception of the My Patients radio selection if the patient has been added by the user by selecting the green plus sign or using the Patient Search.

Right now clinical history is unwieldy. The documentation filter can pull hundreds to thousands of documents, and while you can sort by clicking on the field headers that isn't enough.

1. It is in desperate need of folders. The author(s) of the documents also need to be there, at least for Documentation. There can be a ""multiple"" option if a single note has several contributors, though ideally hoovering would show a list of them. Right now sometimes I have to open multiple documents to find the one I'm looking for. A time signed (in addition to the date) would also be helpful.

2. Being able to have a date range to limit results would also be helpful. Or account number. For some patients, if you are looking for older documents there is SO MUCH scrolling involved.

3. Sorting should not be limited to one column. You should be able to have a primary sort and a secondary sort (maybe even a tertiary one).

4. Entries under Nursing that pull from various flowcharts that aren't used for an admission should either not show up or should be grayed out. Example -- PCA flowsheet. This is ALSO true for info in Reports and Attachments that are empty. That date should either be grayed out or just missing (prefer grayed out).",chomepgh.org,"rhack@hillrh.com Apr 19, 2023
At least a time stamp...please for the love of God add a column with a time stamp! Moving all nursing documentation to eforms has created multiple entries of the same form on the same day. You have to open each one to find the one you're looking for.

The other thing to consider in this is when a user is terminated and that user was utilizing communication, anything outstanding needs to roll over to either the department they are attached to or a supervisor (no way for system to identify supervisor).

We do not need nursing to verify Lab orders for hospital patients. Make it like ER where Lab orders go directly to the Lab.

rhack@hillrh.com May 3, 2023
Having pharmacy/lab orders only linkable to ancillary orders (items) causes issues. There are numerous lab and pharmacy orders that include orders that should be carried out by nursing and respiratory. The solution to create mini order sets to make sure physicians include all of these orders is not efficient. The physicians do not like having the additional order sets for what they call ""simple orders."" Additionally, it is not efficient to have to create multiple zero charge items just to be able to create a linkable ancillary order for nursing. A physician should be able to order an insulin and then be prompted to include a linked bloodsugar check for nursing. Another example, a physician should be able to order an ABG and then be prompted to include a collection order to Respiratory (for those of us that don't have RT run their own labs). This could also be solved by having the option to have orders print to multiple printers.

Eric Brewer May 3, 2023
I think ""Guest"" is describing Chartlink Associated Orders. Linked orders are something different. Pharmacists can link 2 or more orders. Any linked meds must be given together.

Eric Brewer May 3, 2023
From pharmacy's point of view, I think linking orders is working appropriately. I do, however, get calls from nurses after scanning one med, they can't seem to figure out what to do next. It seems that there is insufficient info on the screen to inform the nurse that the order is linked. They have difficulty finding the button to go to the next med.

Eric Brewer May 3, 2023
It would be nice to use the same ""save and link"" functionality from pharmacy order entry in order sets.

Carlos Frausto May 3, 2023
Chad, You gotta look at the big picture. It can't be an all fit in one with this. At my hospital, nurses need to verify the lab because they are the ones drawing it most of the time. How will they know if labs need to be drawn if it goes through lab first for instance over night or out of business hours.

Harold Lawrence May 10, 2023
I have not permitted ""linked"" pharmacy orders for some time (years) related to safety and functionality.

I do think that per the conversation below, we need to make sure that everyone understands that the discussion is around ""linked"" orders and not ""associated"" orders

Lastly, nursing verifying lab orders is necessary depending on the site. If nursing is drawing, they need to verify but also if it is a time sensitive lab, say a drug level, they may need to have that knowledge of lab at med administration.

Good morning everyone! The original idea entry has been updated with several questions:


Linked Orders = two or more medications needing to be given together that will share a frequency, start date/time, and stop date/time.

1. Is linked orders a functionality that is still needed? If so, does this need to be utilized just with Pharmacy and nursing or does this need to be added as a Physician option as well?

4. If we were to go the route of adding the ability to add components/additives to Non-IVs, would this rule out the need for linked orders? An example of this use would be using Coumadin 2.5 MG and Coumadin 5 MG to make Coumadin 7.5 MG.

Kelsey Drouhard May 17, 2023
We have not utilized linked pharmacy orders here for quite some time. I do like the idea of #4 being able to do component Non-IV items, although I wonder how difficult it would be for a nurse to complete in order entry or if there would be item master work,etc. and how this would impact CPOE and Non-Formulary issues, etc. Small sites do not have on site pharmacy 24/7 so that is something to keep in mind.

The other things I would find useful is a good way to incorporate multimodal pain management in a better way and PRN method order and indications. I know our state board of nursing and the accrediting bodies are really getting strict on indications on all PRNs, not duplicating the same class of PRNs for the same reason, and for more clear physician guidelines on which method the nurse should utilize first. It is difficult to fit all of this guidance into a comment area on the med and the instruction often varies based on whether it is a scheduled or PRN med.

derickson@cameronregional.org Jun 22, 2023
#4 is a good idea. We need the ability to build compounded Non-IV orders like we can IV orders (multiple items within one item) but we also need to be able to scan each item within the item at administration. If there are some facilities that do not wish to use this function, they do not have to, just don't build the item... Also, if there is fear of a safety issue, make it a switch that can be turned on or off for your facility. Otherwise, when we make a compounded topical item, there is no way to scan each item without the link item functionality. Each separate item within the compound entered as a separate order would be a disasterous mess on the M.A.R.

Sara Ignacio Jul 21, 2023
There should be several options to ""link medications"" on the MAR. I believe physicians and pharmacists should be the ones entering complicated scheduled tapering doses. If it's simple medications, i.e., suppository docusate and PO docusate, then nursing should be able to link them if given a telephone order. I've worked with other EHRs that have these abilities. The linked medication order should be an option only on ordering medications. ""Do you want to link the medications?"" Or have a button below the medication to ""link medication"" and choose a list of medications it can be linked to, or something along those lines. Medications should only be linked to the same medications; i.e., tylenol linked to tylenol.

* If it's an either PO or IV version of the medication, then if one is given, the other should automatically drop off the MAR. For instance, IV tylenol or PO tylenol on MAR. If PO tylenol is scanned, then the IV tylenol would drop off the MAR, making it not scannable and have the option/""CDS pop-up alert"" for a suggested recommendation to D/C the IV tylenol, as the pt is now taking PO. Then automatically cancel the order and it appear in the verification tray before the order is officially processed to cancel the IV tylenol. (Especially since the IV version is more expensive.)
* If suppository vs PO options of the same medication; i.e., docusate, then if one is scanned (PO option), then the other route option for rectal administration should cancel / disappear off MAR. Both should remain linked to have that option.
* Combination of dosages for 1 medication administration. If scan one, can scan the next dose and the MAR automatically calculate the total dose to be administered. (If 20mg ordered, but only 10mg available, then if 10mg med scanned x2, it would automatically calculate the total dosage without giving an error of ""wrong med"" or ""not ordered for this pt"". Should never have to be another one off order for the same medication, especially when we can't stock a certain dosage at all times.)
* If titration protocol for tapering medications; i.e., phenobarbital used in alcohol withdrawal. There's recommended doses and frequencies, which should go in order, instead of a ""guessing game"" and a ""max dose"" option, as they would all appear on the MAR, causing confusion. For example:

** ***PHENOBARBITAL PO TAPER OPTIONS***

*** **Phenobarbital PO Taper Option for ACTIVE DTs**
*** *STEP #1 for ACTIVE DTs: Phenobarbital 260mg IV x1*.
*** *STEP #2 for ACTIVE DTs: Phenobarbital 97.2mg (3 TABS) PO TID x6 doses*
*** *STEP #3 for ACTIVE DTs: Phenobarbital 64.8 mg (2 TABS) PO TID x6 doses*
*** *STEP #4 for ACTIVE DTs: Phenobarbital 32.4mg (1 TAB) PO TID x6 doses*
*** IF PT HAS ACTIVE DTs: 260mg IV x1, followed by 97.2mg PO TID x6 doses, followed by 64.8mg PO TID x6 doses, followed by 32.4mg PO TID x6 doses

**** (There's no safe way to time this, unless the ordering provider can predict a ""future start date/time"" of the doses or remember to order the next step. It's difficult to build this in an order set.)

Arthur Dimpas Aug 3, 2023
It would be nice also that the system will sense that there is a medication ordered for mild, moderate and severe pain and if there is, it will not allow to order. We got cited because we had 2 pain meds that were ordered for same level.

kimberly hennigan Sep 3, 2023
We'd like to see a ""patch check"" item on the MAR for the days when the patch isn't due, where the nurse has to chart where the patch is and that they are verifying that the patch is still present. It should be either part of the patch item setup itself, or a separate order that we can link to the medication patch order so that the provider doesn't have to remember to order it. We currently have a field for this on our physical assessment flowsheet, but it really belongs on the MAR.

Whitney Rohlman Oct 2, 2023
1. Linked medication orders would ideally be able to be linked via ""AND"" (levothyroxine 125mcg+25mcg to equal 150mcg) or ""OR"" (ex. IV or PO acetaminophen). Physician, nursing and pharmacy should have the option to link upon order entry, and pharmacy order verification.
2. Adding a Link Order button on order entry and pharmacy order verification. Put the order visually together in ORder Chron, the MAR, etc.
3. See #2
4. No, adding linked orders would not rule out the need to add components to non-IVs. For example, we compound oral solutions the Pharmacy and send out a bulk bottle. I wouldn't want staff trying to retrieve those items from Pyxis after the item has already been compounded. They would need to scan the bulk bottle.","caldwellmedical.com,rch-lyons.com,medinamemorial.org,tsjh.org,seminolehospitaldistrict.com,emanuelmedical.org,iberiamedicalcenter.com,lgh-jena.org,pawhuskahospital.com,labettehealth.com,gvh-colorado.org,foresthealth.com,mckenziehealth.org,mchcare.com,eomchospital.com,desotoregional.com,evident.com,hillrh.com"

Currently I am manually generating the forms from with CPSI. One example of missing information is that we currently do not have a unit secretary around the clock, so if there is a patient admitted after she leaves and discharges before she returns (night or weekends), we may miss this. So I have to run a report each day to ensure that we haven't missed any patients. It would be great if anytime there was an admission that a facesheet would print to my printer automatically so that I could follow up, or if I could get an email notification.

Likewise, if reports that we run on a routine basis like admission and discharge reports, late charge reports, etc, could be delivered via email on a scheduled basis.

The general idea is you can create a Custom Role and then use the Copy Security functionality to copy security (including Applications, Behavior Controls, and Screens) from an existing role to the newly created Custom Role. The intention is you would be able to assign users to the Custom Role and not need to just-like anymore. CPSIQ has a course called ""Creating New Roles & Rule Management"" that has some information on this functionality. If you need additional assistance with that functionality, let me know and I will get a situation over to one of our Support Teams to help you out.","schcmed.com,erlanger.org,jchealthcare.com,jackhosp.org,emanuelmedical.org,gmail.com,lgh-jena.org,lifecare-health.com,bayoubendhealth.org,grmf.org,att.net,rayhealthcare.org,kingmanhc.com,eomchospital.com,evident.com,arbucklehospital.com"

Also have the Preventative card pull information from across all facilities. Currently when using Charts, Communication, Preventative List Screen you can view any that were created in any facility.

Physicians may add to the list when the patient is admitted to the hospital, but it is difficult to view it during the clinic stay. We are moving toward PDC instead of Patient Summary, so it would be helpful to build the card without facility restrictions.","caldwellmedical.com,eomchospital.com,spartahospital.com,cmhcare.com"
DFE-I-716,Class II Controlled Substance Prescription Management Enhancements,"Medication Management,Patient Data Console",Default (Unassigned),Needs Review,2023-05-04 20:41:16,6,,"We are struggling because our automated phone messaging directs patients to contact their pharmacy to have refill requests sent electronically. Class II (C2) substances cannot be refilled per federal law so the pharmacy system will not allow refill requests to be sent, therefore directing the patient to contact the clinic. This is frustrating to the patient. We would like to suggest some enhancements to the system to improve the C2 Rx management process:

* Have an indicator next to selected drug when completing a prescription to indicate it is a C2 and carry this to the prescription list. (Immediate request)
* Create a C2 Alert on the Home Screen so that when it gets close to the 30 day stop date the provider is aware and can write a new Rx so the patient does not have to call the office. We know we can run the Prescription History report daily and sort by C2 DEA class but this is not as convenient as having an automated alert.
* We know we can set up scripts with future start dates and send them but we are fearful of what this does to medication reconciliation as the patient comes in to other sites (such as ED) during the 90 day period and these scripts might be dc as duplicate. What if on the initial Rx, there is the ability to mark that close to the end of the 1st Rx, the system sets up a 2nd rx as a pending prescription that we would see in the Unprocessed Prescription Q to review and process and so on with the 3rd script (3 max). Our other concern with setting up and sending all 3 at the same time with the second/third future dated is if the Rx gets changed or cancelled and management of this.
* Console - Home Meds - we would like to be able to have a filter to see controlled substances sorted by class.
* Controlled Substance Checklist - add this in to Rx Entry - each site likely has a checklist of items they require before writing a CS meds - date contract signed, date of last drug screen, date of last visit, etc - it would be nice if we could create this checklist and document at the point of the Rx. Not in each Rx but within Prescription Entry module and triggered for review/entry by the DEA class of the script being written.

We recognize the need to meet the Federal and State regulations around EPCS while at the same time trying to bring to the attention of the provider that the 30 day script is coming due for review and a new script may need to be written or other intervention without a phone call to interrupt the clinic flow. We appreciate starting discussion about this issue.",spartahospital.com,"Sara Kress May 19, 2023

In the Medication Verification application, the ""Patient Medication List"" within the application and the PDF, if more than one patient is selected, there is no delineation between where one patient's medications end and the next patient's medications begin. I have attached an example. By looking at the room # you can see, that this list includes 5 patients. It would be very beneficial for some separation between patients.

@guest Thank you for your feedback. To clarify, is this just an issue with documenting on Dietary orders or are you expecting to see this functionality with Nursing Type orders as well? Can you please provide a use case scenario so we can better understand the need. Any additional feedback is also welcome. Thank you!

Maryanne B Dec 18, 2023
Hi Jenny, thank you for your response. This is just an issue documenting on Dietary orders if there are more than one active orders in Order Chronology.

Case Scenario: Clear liquid diet order placed on patient start time 1500. Regular Diet order also active but from 0800. Nurse clicks on Clear Liquid diet order in Order Chronology. They click Percent Consumed, they change the time to 1450, select 75%, enter comment ""Dinner"" and then click Save. Instead of the Percent Consumed on the Clear Liquid Diet, the documentation is pushed to the Regular diet because the documentation was changed to before the Clear Liquid order start time. This can cause confusion and lose integrity of documentation.

It would be better functionality if there were a hard stop that did not allow the user to save the Percent Consumed entry if the date/time entered was before the order start date/time, either with the date/time picker only active after the order start date/time, or an alert error message that pops up saying ""Date/Time entered before the Order Start Date/Time"". Another suggestion would be an option to auto discontinue all previous active diet orders if a new diet order is being placed.","ahmchealth.com,yahoo.com,eomchospital.com"

Some use an email for the user name some use a number, they all have to be set up separately. These should all be interconnected so If a user has a UBL set up the login information can quickly port into/merge with any other area associated with any Evident platforms. The number of logins that staff is expected to keep up with is growing daily it seems. Having one vender with so many different access points that have to be set up and kept up with is becoming monumental for facility support staff as well as users.",eomchospital.com,"dnewby@prmc.org May 24, 2023
Yes I agree that it would be nice if Evident would have OAuth for all their platforms, especially since they are moving everything to Azure. While they are at it, I'd really love if they would add SAML for Azure AD integration as well so we could truly get to one login for many users. We already using SAML with most of our other SaaS solutions or are in the process of implementing it.

I agree need to get with the century and have SAML for Azure AD, currently only vendor we have that doesn't have this ability.

Dear Trubridge,

Are you actively engaging with these comments? Could we possibly receive a more comprehensive update on the status of these ideas? We're eagerly awaiting to see the direction you take with them. Despite hearing that Dream Factory is the optimal platform for our ideas, it appears that even some of the most well-received suggestions are not gaining traction. Several highly popular concepts have been languishing on Dream Factory for over a year without significant progress being evident to your customers. This stagnation is eroding our confidence and belief that our opinions and ideas hold weight.

Tom Gardner Mar 14, 2024
Multiple Product Owners and other employees are reviewing feedback and new idea submissions. As we adjust our internal processes, you should continue to see increased engagement from the Product Owners. The status of an idea will sometimes be changed without a comment. Several months ago, we improved the status options to provide a clear update on the idea's current status. You can see the description of these statuses on the Dream Factory page within TruLearn.

Janna Sartin Mar 14, 2024
Same canned response

Tom Gardner Apr 11, 2024
We are working on a SSO solution- we do not have a timeline to share at the moment. Come to the Dream Factory in the HUB at our upcoming National Client Conference. Jason Harmon will be able to show a prototype and answer questions.

Laura Colbert Apr 11, 2024
Saw this change to ""In Development"" and I'm doing a little happy dance. I recently did a survey in our facility about the major pain points for the computer use, and ""too many passwords!!"" was a consistent response from our users.

Tracie Bastien Apr 12, 2024
I am hoping this change will still allow users to use the different platforms minus the EHR system. We are rolling out TruLearn as our facility wide learning management system and some users will not need EHR system access.

dnewby@prmc.org Apr 12, 2024
I can't begin to express how happy we are to hear this is coming. We have been migrating all our other systems to SSO to try and limit the number of logins.

Tom Gardner Apr 12, 2024
Hey Tracie!

The current list we are working with is:

* Web Client
* TruBridge Client Center (formerly myCPSI)
* TruLearn (formerly cpsiQ)
* Dream Factory Ideas Portal
* RCM
* FMS
* TruCode Cloud Edition
* TruBridge Analytics
* MyCareCorner CSA Tool

We are still early in the process, so not all of these have been evaluated fully yet. We do not intend to require access to the EHR to be able to use the SSO solution for other areas.

Come see us in the HUB at the Dream Factory booth and talk with Jason Harmon. He would be happy to discuss your specific needs.

Johnathan Fogle Aug 14, 2024

Tom Gardner Aug 19, 2024
Hey Johnathan,

I know work is progressing on this, but I don't have any specific updates to share right now.

Johnathan Fogle Aug 20, 2024
Hey Tom, thanks for getting back to me. Are you guys working on one inhouse TruBridge login for all TruBridge related products, or are you working on true SSO for TruBridge EHR that uses SAML or OAUTH?

Tom Gardner Aug 20, 2024
Hey Johnathan, let me get you in touch with Jason Harmon. He presented about this at our conference in Vegas and will be able to answer all of your questions.

dnewby@prmc.org Aug 21, 2024
SAML would definately be preferred for us.

Tom Gardner Aug 21, 2024
Hey Dustin,

I just updated the admin note on this idea, but replying here as well to make sure everyone sees the information from Jason:

The goal of our SSO work is to allow two fundamental capabilities:

* For TruBridge customers to be able to use a single common user credential to access all TruBridge and related services
* For TruBridge customers to be able to use an external identity provider of their choice as their TruBrudge credential.  This can include ActiveDirectory, Google App Suite, or any other OAuth, SAML, or LDAP identity provider.

The solution being worked on is to have all TruBridge products authenticated using a common federated identity mechanism, specifically KeyCloak, which in turn is configured to allow each customer organization to choose their preferred user identity system and authenticate to TruBridge applications using it.  For those customers who don't wish to use an external identity source, KeyCloak itself can be the identity provider. This mechanism will allow customers to use their organizational ActiveDirectory accounts, Google G-Suite accounts, or any identity provider support SAML, OAuth, or LDAP to be used for TruBridge application access.

1. Add a field for diagnosis....preferably one that can pull from the problem list.
2. Add Faxing, Mailing, and Printing of the information entered into R/TOC.
3. Allow the R/TOC to flow to Notes through a filter.

For example, one area I see this most useful is within value based and care coordination programs. We are part of multiple value based and care coordination programs, some of the programs provide supportive staff such as Community Health Workers. Currently we are sending emails or communications to these CHW's when a referral is needed and then documenting in R/TOC. With these additional components we could streamline this referral process for our providers/clinical staff.


Another area that we utilize the R/TOC outside of its original intent is ancillary procedures. If we have a patient receiving a radiology study or lab work outside of our facility, we add it to R/TOC so we can track. It would be great if we could quickly add the DX and then send it on from the R/TOC screen.


Tracking specialty providers, and ensuring providers are documenting the relationship within their notes is an important piece to capturing 340B referral claims.

This is a huge problem for medical records. Printing numerous records freezes up the computer and it takes at least 45 minutes to generate the records.

Pam Rowley Feb 27, 2024
Printing the patient chart in Print Electronic Record is taking up far too much of our staff's time compared to how it worked in Centriq. Requests for the entire medical record take much longer to process than they should, especially if the patient has a lot of visits. Going in and out of each visit selecting the documents is very inefficent, and then when you are finished it can take a long time for the document to load. There needs to be a better way. Print Electronic Record is cumbersome and slow.

Pam Rowley Aug 26, 2024
There is an issue with Print Electronic Record, support could not fix it - see situation# 10088656. They told me to put in a dream factory request. I will add it to this dream factory topic, since it is basically what others are saying.


When selecting Print Electronic Record > Medical Record Number - to print documents from multiple accounts - this does not function well for ""frequent flier patients"" that have 50 plus accounts to load. It can take 30-40 minutes just for the list of accounts to generate. Then, once we select the documents we need on each account and click on Print > Windows, it can take another 30 minutes for the PDF to generate.

The support tech was told that Print Electronic Record was not designed to work for patients with many many accounts. This is NOT acceptable. Please find a way to make this a more efficient and quick process.

When they enter the name of a controlled substance it should alert them to check PDMP.  If they check it they should be Ble to enter multiple controlled substances in that session without being forced to check every time they enter a controlled substance name again.  If they were to leave medication ordering then enter a controlled again later it should prompt them to check again

Preferably have the pop up before selecting the process button. If there was a section that if the PMP was entered in, they won't get the pop up. If there is nothing in that space then have the pop up. As this then won't give pop up fatigue if they are being compliant with checking the PMP.

Removing the all-inclusive NKA option is part of the design for the new Allergies & Intolerances Console card. We are working on this development now. With that said, the expectation is that the Allergies & Intolerances console card will be available on the PDC 1.10.0 release later this year. This new card will also take the place of the EHR Allergies application in a future release (target is PDC 1.12.0 release) so the NKA option will no longer be available anywhere in the system.

Hi there, thank you for your feedback! Could you share some examples of areas in the system where you would like to see the character limit increased?

Any examples or use cases where you are needing to document more than what the character limit allows will be very helpful as we evaluate future changes. Thanks again!

jamieh@mocohd.org Dec 7, 2023
Yes, this is a big issue through out the system, however the primary area we are needing more characters is in the pharmacy module. There is not enough characters to have complete drug builds without using abbreviations which is not standard of practice. There is not enough space for drug name, strength and dosage in the drug builds. All of the abbreviations make it hard for staff to find the medications in order entry, then they aren't sure if that is the right medication or drug combo because of the limited space. Pharmacy can not create drug builds for all necessary IV infusions, including antidotes. There is not enough character s to differentiate the different doses and volumes that are required based on pts weight. The character limit of the description/comment field with the drug build is so limited even a short piece of information can not be conveyed.

Also, we have issues with patients who have very long names as well as long addresses being fully captured. This again causes issues with finding the correct patient and mailing issues.

I have a lot more examples if needed.

Thanks!

Mark Boomhower Dec 7, 2023
My idea DFE-I-493 falls right in line with this idea and is an area within the pharmacy that is an example. So the need for more characters isn't always in areas where users document...it's on setup screens as well.

Sarah Dotson Dec 7, 2023
I agree with Guest below. I am currently trying to go through the pharmacy item master and standardize our item names. However, on most medications I can't fit all the necessary information. To give a specific example, I end up having to cut the end off of medication names (acetylcysteine) just so I can include the name brand (Mucomyst vs Acetadote), when truly both pieces of information are very important. I am aware I can put the brand name in as an alternate name, but when a provider searches ""acetyl"" and all they can see is acetylcysteine without the name brand, it would be very easy to choose the wrong one. They can't see the alternate name. If they choose the wrong one, then the Pyxis will not dispense the correct medication, leading to confusion and delays in getting Acetadote, a very important antidote, to the patient.

Vaccines are an absolute nightmare in this case and it has lead to several medication errors because I cannot fit all the information I want in the item master name. For example, Engerix-b is the hepatitis B vaccine. Its hard enough just to fit the brand and generic name and strength/volume. But then you need to differentiate age. All we could fit was ""ped"" and ""adult"" to differentiate. However, the ""adult"" dose of Engerix-b is only approved for 20 years of age and older, therefore 18 and 19 year olds receive the ""ped"" dose. Several patients have incorrectly received the 20 years + dose of the vaccine because it says ""adult"" and in general, 18 and 19 year olds are considered adults, but they should have received the pediatric dose. This is a huge issue with the COVID vaccines as well.

There are many medications where it would be optimal to have the concentration per ml listed along with the overall strength and volume. For example, propofol (Diprivan) 1,000mg/100ml vials. I have to choose between saying this is a 1,000mg/100ml vial or saying this is a 10mg/ml 100ml vial. For certain calculations, especially of bolus doses, it would be optimal to have the 10mg/ml concentration information, but for other situations it should also be easy to identify the total amount of drug in an entire vial without expecting the nurse to do math in a high stress situation.

This is nowhere near being an all inclusive list of the moments I have become frustrated and spent a lot of time and energy dealing with the character limit in the pharmacy item master. As I am going through the item master, probably every 10-15 drugs I run into an issue where I have to make choices I don't want to make. Hope this helps explain the issue at hand.

Jeanette  Adams  Dec 8, 2023
Also within Flowchart Questions and Answers. I have to get really creative sometimes to fit what needs to be added within the character limits, especially the answers.

Tana o&#39;neill Dec 8, 2023
This is a huge patient safety issue, and I feel does not meet best practice criteria, especially in pharmacy. This cannot be fixed soon enough and should be escalated immediately!

April Davis Apr 18, 2024
This is an issue on the AP side as well. When adding new vendors, we can not add a full name/business/etc to match a W-9 as their is not enough character spaces. It is the same way on the AKA line and the address line. We have to abbreviate names and for tax purposes we should not be doing that. In looking at the printed checks there is plenty of space to add more characters. The abbreviated names could also be the reasoning behind lost checks in the mail.

Hi Jeanette,
Can you expand on this? What other options/descriptors would you expect to see on the Administration screen? Where are you currently documenting this information?

Sarah Blazier Dec 7, 2023
Just to give you an example for our small surgical facility - pain management is audited by our quality dept on every patient that stays overnight. They review pain scale, pain location, pattern (ex: acute, chronic, etc), intensity, and the intervention. This is time consuming becasuse if a pain medication is given the nurse is documenting in the flowchart. The reassessment is also in the flowchart. The medication review is in the MAR. - you have to go back and forth to check documentation against the MAR.

Best case scenario would be for this documentation to be captured in the MAR during administration and then reassessment documented in the MAR in the recommended time frame. That way the reviewer would only have to look at the Medication Report or the Patient Progrees Notes. But there is not enough room to enter all the needed documentation. We do not use the reassessment because there is too much duplicate documentation.

Absolute dream would be if the MAR assessment and reassessment documentation would show up in the flowchart also.


You can use the nursing care plan to document intervetions and attach them to the pain questions - but usually the nurse forgets to ONLY document the pain questions and then click the red 'Problem mode' - it's just not intuitive. Then you have the entire assessment to review for the pain intervention in the Problem List report - again - it is not pulling the medication adminsitration either.

Jeanette  Adams  Dec 8, 2023
We would like to be able to document pain level and descriptors such as cramping, sharp, dull, heavy, etc. It would be nice to be able to put the location of the pain as well.

Shouldn't there be an interface between the ""MAR"" and the ""Prescription Entry"" to automatically pull the ""Last Given"" date & time for those medications to be continued on discharge, as well as an automatic timing of the ""Next Due"" for the next dose based on the frequency of the medication?

It also needs to be blocked from going to patient portal and not included in any stats. And there needs to be a status change that can be sent through HL7 interfaces.


We are running into an issue with our Syndromic Reporting too because of these ""invalid"" episodes and implementations ""fix"" to change the admission date and discharge to 01/01/01. We need it to inactivate the account so that it does not count in stats and a change in status message sent thru the interface so that the State knows that it is not a valid episode and we get dinged for not having admission date/time, discharge date/time, chief complaint, discharge disposition, and diagnosis codes. Very rarely can you delete unless you do it within seconds of creating the visit because something that the system does makes it to where you cannot delete. We have looked and no one has documented or added anything to the episode when we cannot delete. So there is something happens that makes it where you cannot delete the account. And with our state reporting, we still get dinged as missing data because they do not know it was deleted.

What parameters do you currently use to determine when to combine accounts other than date of service and stay type? Would you ever have an OP and IP account to combine (example, patient came in to facility as OP and was discharged, but later that day was brought back and admitted as IP). Would the auto combine need to work for any other scenarios other than billing purposes, such as combing accounts under one guarantor? Would you combine to the oldest account or newest account?

Jennifer Baumgartner Dec 5, 2023
They were all same day. We did have a few instances where they were an outpatient and then were also admitted to inpatient on the same day. Mainly for billing. I would like to know more about your question of combing accounts under one guarantor, if that would allow for us to look up guarantor balance easier than running reports, then ABSOLUTELY! We combined to the newest visit. Also the RHC auto-separates the ancillary charges (lab, radiology, and EKG) to a hospital 851 claim and Centriq would auto-combine it to another OP claim if it was there on the same day too.

Hi Emma, I would like to get a little more information on the changes you would like to see. Are you referring to the System Menu registration workflow?

It would be nice if we could have it through the system menu way as that is what our registration department currently uses. Sometimes for ecample we have a patient come in and they have to have two separate accounts as one is lab that has to be registered through quest and one is radiology but we need to be able to access both of these charts to get them registered for both tests and oftentimes theres a lot of backing out and re-entering back into the patient account. Or sometimes we get multiple patients coming into our ER and on weekends we only have 1-2 people registering patients and we have to finish those accounts but we have to completely close out of them to register another patient. We sometimes don't have the time to write down the account number or print out a facesheet to remember the patients name or information so it would be nice if we could have a ""tab"" open with that account so we could more easily get back to it.","medinamemorial.org,dosher.org,osshealth.com,lgh-jena.org,pchsgrant.com,yahoo.com,nrmchealth.com,gordonmemorial.org"

Mary,

I'd also like to add that it is a lot to dig through, with no clue what the keyword might be. I think if you queried users, you might find that it doesn't get used. The only efficient way to find them is to check it at least 3 times a week so one doesn't get behind and have to dig through piles of known issues. And we all know that doesn't happen. CENTRIQ took care of us by passing on major known issues, and we miss it. I've tried to dig through the Known Issues, it's so much faster to put in a sit. This kind of ties in with my complaints about ACCESS. There's nothing in it, it's just a reminder to go read the list it shares a page with, because that's where the good stuff is. CENTRIQ would highlight the major known issues in their ACCESS. I shouldn't have to put in a sit to find out that users can't print from Notes and it's a known issue. That's kind of a big deal. And it's a pain point.

I agree with Kimberly Hennigan that I used to look at known issues before entering a situation, but so many times the known issue wasn't listed and would find out it is a known issue once I starting talking about the situation I entered.

Thanks Sara for the additional info. We have worklist on our previous EMR and it was helpful to track items that were not done by the nurse/nursing staff. Order Chronology is not really helpful to us especially when you have lots of orders/items (like in ICU) to the extent that it will impact patient safety since the nurse has no time reading/reviewing OC.

We have a Task List in the planning stages. We have to start with making the nursing orders like ""VS every 8 hours"" structured with the ability to add a frequency to them.

To expound upon this further, I feel the ""descriptors"" of the path users are taking which could also then be clicked on to take you directly to the specific patient and document or area accessed. It is very difficult to complete a comprehensive review of an audit trail when the naming conventions don't really tell you anything. Example, and I apologize for the comparison to Centriq: Ability to have a drop down that not only covers a specific date range, but also additional dropdowns for search of specified user (both actual name and username), drop down with search for patient names, drop down with search for specific area of chart such as Notes, Lab, Documents and ability to search from dropdown for service type (IP, ER, OP, etc.).

I have asked for YEARS to add patient names to the audit logs. It is so frustrating when you pull a report with 20-30 accounts (or more), and then have to go enter every account to find and type the name in the report. Many of the other systems we use list patient names in the audit reports. Why has CPSI/Evident/Trubridge refused to add this? Create another report that shows who pulled a security audit report and all of the patients that were listed if you want to track who looked at patient names. You could create a switch that you can choose: Include Patient Name (Yes or No) if someone doesn't need the patient name. Not sure why they wouldn't...you're going to go enter every single account number to find the patient name as soon as you run the audit report anyway.

Dear Trubridge,

Are you actively engaging with these comments? Could we possibly receive a more comprehensive update on the status of these ideas? We're eagerly awaiting to see the direction you take with them. Despite hearing that Dream Factory is the optimal platform for our ideas, it appears that even some of the most well-received suggestions are not gaining traction. Several highly popular concepts have been languishing on Dream Factory for over a year without significant progress being evident to your customers. This stagnation is eroding our confidence and belief that our opinions and ideas hold weight.

Tom Gardner Mar 14, 2024
Multiple Product Owners and other employees are reviewing feedback and new idea submissions. As we adjust our internal processes, you should continue to see increased engagement from the Product Owners. The status of an idea will sometimes be changed without a comment. Several months ago, we improved the status options to provide a clear update on the idea's current status. You can see the description of these statuses on the Dream Factory page within TruLearn.

Can you elaborate on what kind of things you would like to update the chart with from Notes? We can currently add Surgical History and the Chief complaint.

Also if you are using PDC you can push radiology results to your note, as well as, update a lot of information via PDC and then simply pull it into your note.

I undrstand you can pull a lot of things into the note but I think it would be nice if things charted in the note can go and update the patients chart. For example, we have a dietary note and they chart in it the appropriate diet order. It would be nice if that automatically updated the chart with the new diet order so they didn't have to adjust it in the chart after they put it in the note.

Sara Kress Dec 5, 2023
EKG's are done on the EKG machine (obviously) and then they automatically go to a shared network drive. They are then attached to the order. This is so that it 1)doesn't get lost and 2)can be viewed by anyone as soon as possible. They then have to print it and it gets placed in a physical box for providers to check and they write their interpretation on the EKG, then it gets scanned. So now we have 2 copies of the same EKG, there isn't a replace image option. If the provider could get assigned the image from CardioPulm/RespTher, then they could make a comment or note similar to the rest of the Home Screen charting options. I think those launch to Chart Communication and that isn't a handy location to view it from.

An antibiotic timeout is a provider-led reassessment (48-72 hours after beginning empiric antibiotics) of the continuing need and choice of antibiotics when the clinical picture is clearer and more diagnostic information, especially results of cultures and rapid diagnostics, is available.

Provider-led reviews of antibiotics can focus on four key questions:

* Does this patient have an infection that will respond to antibiotics?
* Have proper cultures and diagnostic tests been performed?
* Can antibiotics be stopped or improved by narrowing the spectrum (also referred to as ""de-escalation"") or changing from intravenous to oral?
* How long should the patient receive the antibiotic(s), considering both the hospital stay and any post-discharge therapy?

Is it possible to require this reassessment by the physician on antibiotics? Possibly similar to the auto-stop notification? Send the doctor a message with these four questions on each antibiotic after 48 hours and require the provider to answer each with a drop down answer and the answer to the last question will result in a hard discontinue of this antibiotic. This information will also need to be pulled to a report for inspectors.

We have been needing a way to notify providers that a 72 hour review is due on a medication for several years. This idea addresses the issues we face. The current ""Antimicrobial Review"" available in the application drawer has no visual queue to let providers know a review needs to be done and there is no way to set up a notification to go to their home screen folders. We need this solution to be structured more like what is described in this idea and the ability to have some type of notification within the providers workflow when these reviews are due is a very important part. I have a situation where I was trying to find a way to use the system to send notifications to my providers to complete this task but we were unsuccessful. Situation: 9992702

By not ""dog fooding"" their own product, they will be blind to inefficiencies that their users experience while using myCPSI. For example, apparently filtering in myCPSI by ""Only Escalated Sits"" does not work, but does in CPSI's internal system (again, according to the CPSI employee).",itinspired.com,"Paul Hendrix Dec 1, 2023
Other issues I've noticed with myCPSI:

1. Regarding CPSI representatives ""dog fooding"" their own products, I have previously mentioned specific action numbers within a given SIT and the representatives do not know what I'm referring to. In the attached image, I've circled the action number in red.
2. When a CPSI representative responds to a SIT, sometimes their display name shows as ""Customer Action"" (see the highlighted yellow text in the attached image). I'm not sure if this is intentional, but when this happens I don't know if I'm speaking with the same person or new representative. If it's a new person, I may edit my response to provide more context so they're able to better assist me.
3. There is superfluous text in representatives' responses. For example, in the attached image circled in green, the representative prefaces their responses with ""Call-Bk Memo: See customer ICMS callback action: #"". I'm not sure why this is needed. It creates visual clutter and forces me to hunt and find the representative's actual response.
4. Especially for new myCPSI users, the use of abbreviations like LVM, GOL, ICMS, CW5, CL5, IF, TWC, TUX, CPCB, UBL, etc. are too cryptic. It would be better if these were always spelled out or, preferably, easy to lookup while remaining on the same webpage.
5. There is no clear distinction between who's who in a given SIT. Yes, there are ""Display Name"" fields, but those don't always indicate the user's name (see bullet point #2 above) and, more importantly, each response looks the same – there's no visual indication that I or a representative responded.
For contrast, Apple's group messaging largely gets this right (see attached) – my responses are in blue bubbles and right-aligned while other users' responses are in gray bubbles, left-aligned, include their full name, and have a profile image.
6. While creating a new situation, I find it tedious to see all the application support groups and sub-groups available (let alone pick the correct one). I ended up scrapping the HTML for these dropdown fields and placed those groups in a Google Sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A_fDS8dZbCC_z1bVW5rlNW_PLnACJ4o5fRtFZJcvPVE/edit?usp=sharing) that I can search (Ctrl + F). It makes filling out new SITs easier and quicker.

Paul Hendrix Dec 7, 2023
Today I realized that there is a session timeout that is not immediately clear.

For example, I left myCPSI open in my web browser overnight. Today, I went to the same myCPSI tab in my web browser, clicked ""Create New Situation"" and began entering all necessary information. However, when I clicked ""Submit"" nothing happened. Only when I closed the myCPSI tab in my web browser, opened a new tab, went to myCPSI, and logged in would it allow me to click ""Submit"". The downside was I had to re-enter all the necessary information (application dropdowns, description, and details).

I don't mind there being a session timeout, but its duration should be displayed to the end user and myCPSI should kick me back to the login screen once timed out.

Paul Hendrix Dec 13, 2023
myCPSI will send email notifications when a SIT you're associated with receives an update. If you click on this link, myCPSI's login page will load. However, after you enter your credentials and click ""LOGIN"", nothing will happen. Other users at our facility have noted the same behavior on their machines.

Paul Hendrix Dec 19, 2023
1. This is more of an education issue, but multiple CPSI representatives have called me and left voicemails without referencing the SIT number in question. Normally I can use context to figure out which SIT they are referring to, but it is time consuming if they are vague or if I have many SITs open.
2. Approximately 20% of the time, SITs updated by a CPSI representative never result in an email notification being sent to me. I'm not sure if notifications are manually triggered by the rep the other 80% or if I'm unknowingly doing something that's causing it to not send. I've verified that my email filters are not inadvertently catching these, too.

Paul Hendrix Jan 5, 2024
What does this zig zag arrow mean? Why is there no tooltip when you hover over it? There's no clear indication what it is.

Paul Hendrix Jan 31, 2024
It'd be helpful if my login state was cached so that opening myCPSI in a new tab would not require me to log in again. For example, if I log into myCPSI, open a new tab, and navigate to myCPSI again it will require me to sign in again.

Paul Hendrix Apr 10, 2024
1. It'd be helpful if I could ""pin"" specific SITs.
2. TruBridge Client Center (formerly myCPSI) has poor support for mobile. While using an iPhone 15 Pro (iOS 17.4.1), I'll receive an email from TruBridge Client Center with a link to view new information in an ongoing SIT (I'm using Gmail's app which opens links in an in-app Safari web browser).

a. After I open the link, scrolling is not as responsive as it is in native iOS apps; almost like there's JavaScript overriding how quick/fluid scrolling should be.
b. When entering text for a new action, automatic grammar edits (for example, capitalizing the first letter in a sentence) do not happen. I can navigate to another website and this works as expected. I think this may be because the HTML's global attribute for autocapitalize is incorrectly set.
c. The left and right margins are huge (see screenshot). I wish the text took up more of this space.

Scanned Documents are not organized. Scanned Documents should be placed in Facility determined/created Dividers (IAW their scanning\image title policy). When a user looks in scanned documents, they should see the dividers\tabs first and determine where they want to look. The current view is way to busy and confusing.

In Healthland Centriq they had a really nice setup for the dividers. It would show every divider for whichever episodes you chose and would either have them collapsed or expanded. You could filter out your dividers by visit, date, source, type, and creator. You could also have these in a collapsed format as shown or you could have them expanded so you could see every single thing that was scanned under that divider.

At HRRMC we have decided that the CRNAs will use the charge app to accomplish this ""near charge at administration"" functionality by allowing them to scan medication during a case and document the actual dose given for waste capture and real time charge generation. Unfortunately we are going to have to scan in the GTIN for all medications found in their Pyxis so that they can scan and pull up the correct item number, furthermore there is not the same level of detail that could be captured in the MAR regarding medication administration. For this to be a widespread useful tool, the charge app would need to be able to scan items based on page 2 in pharmacy information and capture the same level of detail as the MAR. Perhaps it would be a new app specific for providers. Providers do not need orders and therefore they do not need orders verified, but they do need to be able to accurately document in real time medication administration and subsequently participate in charge at administration, which the gold standard for patient charging/documentation. Please feel free to schedule a call to discuss.

DFE-I-1035,Communication Center Mailbox replacing current Chart Communication app,Communication Center,Default (Unassigned),Product Owner Review,2023-09-14 00:09:29,15,,"Today it was stated that since Chart Communication is a legacy application it likely won't have any enhancements made to it. Comm Center Mailbox will likely replace Chart Communication. Although I believe this is a step in the right direction, I want to make sure it is well thought out so here is some feedback:

1. Current Mailbox is outside of a patient's chart and although the conversation can be saved to a patient record, there is risk that at the point it is saved the conversation may continue and the entire conversation is not saved. I would like to see design so that if a conversation is started outside of a patient chart there is no way to save it to the patient chart thus necessitating that a message that should be in a patient chart is started within a patient chart. or alternatively, some other means that when a mailbox message is started it is immediately tied to a patient thus saving it in the patient chart and making it accessible from the patient chart should the patient call or otherwise make contact anywhere in our system. I know you can select a patient and attach from a patient when composing new mail but it doesn't save the message to the patient chart. We require everyone to review open communications as they may contain information of messages left for a patient that need relayed at the next possible encounter with the patient.
2. A patient specific message needs to be able to be routed to staff assigned to groups assigned to providers so that we can get away from department notifications and route messages to staff working roles for individual providers or groups of providers. Triage staff should be sent some messages that need clinical input yet other messages about scheduling may go to a different group and referral request to yet a different group. all based on a role that a person is working that day. Tomorrow they may be working a different role. Our staff do travel that much and work different or multiple roles.
3. There should be a PDC card for messages open/incomplete that are unique to a patient in their chart similar to chart communications that can be referenced during a visit or patient contact and completed by anyone.
4. I feel there needs to be work on the address book in Communication Center. We now have 6 faxage # and already we identify that each fax # would benefit from their own address book since they are distinctly unique in many ways on who they fax to. Since Mailbox is all internal, I would like to see the ability to carve out entries that are made strictly for faxing from what display when I look up to create a new message. We are also just beginning to start secure texting so I'm not sure how that is going to muddy the address book . We already have duplicates and need to do a clean up. What security behaviors exist around the address book? How can any CPSI representatives that are in the address book be hidden? If users are set up for interface purposes, can they be marked not to show in the address book? Can test MD and users be set not to show in the address book unless we choose to have them show?
5. Can there be a discussion about saving messages at a profile level vs a visit level. I was actually signed in to our clinic facility but attached a hospital note and sent it to the PCP. But when I went to attach the communication to an encounter it is only showing me clinic encounter when in reality I felt like this could go to either a clinic or hospital encounter but most definitely needs to show at the patient level in either facility. When patients call they don't always call associated with a specific encounter but with general questions. We always pick the most recent visit because that is what we have to do. It would be nice to progress to placing the message on the patient as a whole.
6. When attaching as designed today to an encounter, the Subject line becomes the Document Name, the Document type defaults to Healthcare Communication Document but we have to create and select a Document Category. Can this be reviewed and assessed? Is a document category truly necessary vs a general default category to save us clicks and time? Then it shows in clinical history as a scanned image. How about a new filter for Healthcare Communication Documents so the provider can filter on or off - Messages. In some patients these can be numerous and truly eat up the clinical history app so hiding them would be a blessing. If the provider has them filtered on then it would be nice if incomplete/unanswered ones would display in a different color or with an indicator so the provider could address them or at least be aware of them.

I'm sure there will be more but this is what we have for now. Thank you!",spartahospital.com,"Sara Kress Nov 1, 2023
To add:

1. We have some chart communication messages for the year. If they are a nursing home patient, there is frequent communication and we are not going to make a new message each time. Also Controlled Substance and Pharmacy managed Coumadin clinic continue.
2. In the clinic, most chart communication is sent to the that physicians nurse. What if the nurse is sick that day and other staff fill in and need to keep working that list? What if they are in an accident, get hospitalized, have surgery - how can anyone else access those messages that have been sent if there isn't a group or the current option of Associations? The nurse left last night at 5pm, the provider worked until 7pm and sent messages for them to followup with patients regarding their lab or radiology results. They just stay stuck in the original users inbox forever and no one can get to them?","prmc.org,fairfaxmed.com,rch-lyons.com,edcomed.com,lgh-jena.org,bayoubendhealth.org,franklinfoundation.org,ahmchealth.com,yahoo.com,okmh.org,kchc.net,monroesurgical.com,spartahospital.com,cmhcare.com"

Our facility is requesting an enhancement to the current integration with the Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) within the TruBridge EHR system. All our providers have expressed a strong need for a feature that automatically logs PMP checks directly into the patient's chart.

This log should ideally capture the following information:

Date and Time of PMP Check: Creates a clear audit trail for each patient encounter.

Accessing Provider: Ensures transparency and accountability for each check.

An even more valuable feature would be the ability to optionally include a summary of the data reviewed during the PMP check. This would provide a more complete picture for future reference and informed prescribing decisions.

Integrating a PMP history log into the EHR system would offer significant benefits for both our patients and providers:

Improved Patient Safety: A readily available history log allows for more informed prescribing decisions and reduces the risk of medication misuse.

Enhanced Provider Protection: A documented record of PMP checks demonstrates adherence to best practices and fulfills regulatory requirements.

We believe this enhancement would significantly improve the workflow and efficiency of our providers while directly contributing to our commitment to patient safety.

Thanks for the comment @guest. I can certainly see why you would want these to not be available in this scenario. One additional question, how often would someone un publish a template to do some work on it and then re publish when they're done? Just thinking about both sides here - if that is a common practice, and these templates we're auto-removed from favorited lists, then users would need to re-favorite them after re-publishing the template.

Then we could set a date range that we would see overdue and due exams for January that we would then see all the patients due for that exam, test, etc. Then we would generate a letter, and click on a box to show that we printed the letter to send. It took a lot of the guess work out of reminding patients for what they were due for. Now in the preventative list in Thrive the only thing we are able to do is enter a due date, a note about what it is, and what the communication method is which must be defaulted from their profile. Then we can run a report for the overdue preventatives, but that is all. There needs to be a way to generate a letter from there and show that it was printed/sent.

I've tried to get them to use it but they won't. And I dont' blame them -- I don't like it either. It is too bulky and difficult to scan. It has a lot of unnecessary info that gets in the way.

Please add the following features to the standard view: the ability to sort based on nursing order category (so that orders can be grouped together by type), the ability to resort by clicking on column headers and resize columns (so that they can see all of the order detail) and have it STICK when they go to print. Currently, all sorting/resizing of columns that is done within standard view isn't maintained when you generate the pdf. Consequently my staff are still printing the Medact, which isn't accurate since it does not contain ancillary orders. It is also a barrier to our facility fully adopting web client as staff are not willing to use Order Chron to print their orders.

To make it even better:

* do away with expanded view. Have a dropdown caret that they can click on to see the info that is in expanded view when needed
* make it so ALL order instructions show up in standard view. Don't cut them off.
* whatever formatting changes are made on the screen need to stick when the pdf is generated.

Have you looked at the 24 Hour Summary options for this ""ticket to ride"" type functionality?


Also, note that Nursing Order Category is in the Additional Info column and may be sorted.

kimberly hennigan Nov 1, 2023
Some staff use the 24 hr summary but it is not the same as an order printout, which is what we need.

The nursing order category can be sorted, but it is only available in the expanded review style so that doesn't help when my issue is that my nurses won't use the expanded review style. It would be nice if the nursing order category was available in the standard review style, but it would only be helpful IF you could sort by it and it would STICK when you print. Which is my issue. Nothing in the standard review style sticks when the pdf is generated.

Michelle Mason Nov 1, 2023
Appreciate the update. When you say order printout, what are you envisioning? I recommended the 24 Hr Summary (or Patient Summary) because it can be configured to include all orders and show all lines of a Nursing Order along with the most recent comment.

The Category is available in the Standard view in the Additional Information column and is sortable.

kimberly hennigan Nov 1, 2023
Ok, I see now where the order category is available in standard view, but that doesn't really change anything. You can sort by it, but that sort does not stick when you generate the pdf. Which again, is the entire issue. Changes made to Order Chron standard view do not stick when the pdf is generated.


I'm not sure why you are brining up the 24 hours summary when we are looking for a way to print order chron. It does have some settings you can tweak in nursing chart masters, but ""tweak"" is about the extent of it. The 24 hour summary contains more than orders, it prints on more than one page even when one page would do (because of the graph that I can't get rid of), and it isn't very well organized. It has info we don't need and is missing info we do need. (Most staff hate that VS/I&O graph. It takes up way too much room for little value.)


What we are envisioning is a printout of order chron that does maintains whatever changes that are made to the display when the pdf is generated/the orders are printed. So if the columns are resized so that the entire order can be seen, that is maintained. If the column headers are used to resort the orders, that is maintained. They shouldn't be sticky to the point where that same sort order is maintained when you go to another chart; it just needs to stick when order chron is printed.

Michelle Mason Nov 2, 2023
Existing documents like the 24 Hr Summary have been used for taking patients to appointments outside the building because they do include information like vitals to reference during those appointments, do not cut off Nursing Orders, include the last documented comment, can include omitted or PRN medications given, etc.

From your comments, I see you are looking for the PDF document from Order Chron to print as you have it on the screen.","caldwellmedical.com,lgh-jena.org,yahoo.com,chomepgh.org"

The view for the application drawer is sticky.

So, if you're clicking the pin after either of these, you're unpinning it. Once you have it pinned, it will display that way the next time you log in to that device.

Kelsey Drouhard Oct 9, 2023
I think maybe some further investigation should be done Michelle. Could it be possible that if you log in to Thrive UX app on the desktop that it will revert the pinned app status next time you log in to web client? That may be what is happening to me. All I know is that each time I have logged in to web client, I have to go back through that entire pin process. Carrot to expand, click pin, then it disappears, then click thrive, then pin it again. It's extremely annoying. I just think the design is not really working as intended for those of us who are actually using web client. Or TRYING to use web client. I am happy to web ex with anyone to ""prove"" that this is happening as I have had the scenario occur numerous times and had others complain about it. Enough so that I took the time to come to the idea factory with it. Thanks.

Michelle Mason Oct 9, 2023
I definitely believe you. I am in and out of Web Client and TUX regularly but am on the same device with the same Window's login. I'm met with the default view when I log into a new server but that is expected. I can understand how frustrating that would be if it was every time.

Michelle Mason Oct 25, 2023
Email interaction showed that requester was clearing web cache frequently which wiped out the sticky settings.

Linda Pfeifle Oct 25, 2023
This is a problem for us, too. We are told to clear the web cache because it causes problems in other areas, so we clear it every time we close out of Google Chrome. There should be a way to make it still be defaulted even though that is being done. Could there be a check box or drop down so it isn't just sticky?

Kelsey Drouhard Oct 26, 2023
Michelle, I still take issue with the fact that the original process does not pin on the first attempt. Should I submit a new idea for this? Or can you remove the ""already exists"" and I can amend the bit that I narrowed down to cache clearing?? I still shouldn't have to click so many times to pin so I think that needs to be looked at again from design standpoint.

Michelle Mason Oct 26, 2023
We can certainly take it back to review. The default is the ""icon view"" like in TUX. Clicking just the E at the top will open and pin the side panel om the ""drawer view"". It sounds like you are wanting that to be the default view.

Kelsey Drouhard Oct 26, 2023
That's how it should work, but it doesn't. When I log in and open the drawer and pin it, it just closes the drawer completely. Then I have to click ""Thrive"" to open and pin again and then it stays. (Until cache clears again. It shouldn't take 4 clicks at the start to pin the drawer for users.

Michelle Mason Oct 26, 2023
If you are starting from icon view, click the E. At that point it is open and pinned. If you are clicking the pin, you are unpinning it.

Kelsey Drouhard Oct 26, 2023
Michelle, that worked. Which web client user guide is this in? I would like to be able to send out to my users as most, like myself, think that the Pin would pin rather than clicking the ""E - Thrive"" logo to pin. Thanks!

Nikki Csiki Oct 26, 2023
It seems the simples solution would be for Evident to change the default. Clinical users pretty much never choose to use the icon view; they need everything open and ready to go every time they log in.

Michelle Mason Oct 26, 2023
Kelsey, there is a video that shows using the ""expand"" arrow at the bottom. I have just always used the E when logging in to a new server.

Tracie Bastien Oct 26, 2023
The thing for the programmers to remember is, if the icon only view is the default view and the user has to pin it open for the icon description when logging in for the first time, the people that log in for the first time are typically new users. New users have no idea what the icons mean and the extra steps taken to default it to open with descriptions is confusing.

Just got out of a physicians meeting. This was a complaint. The NOTE needs to drive the update to the EHR applications. Not the applications driving the NOTE. Problem List is a great example. Physicians have to go to the traditional application or console. Enter data, flag treated this visit, add comments, whatever. Then make sure the Problem List is up to date. Then create the NOTE and insert the data. If there is a issue, they have to leave the document, access the application, make corrections, additions, whatever, then reaccess the NOTE. Remove this incorrect information and reinsert the new. Many many steps.

Yes! Providers are required to document Diagnoses within their notes. If these Diagnoses would drive the Problem List - we would get a lot more buy-in. We have surgeons who refuse to use Notes and instead use Surgical CAPD because their diagnoses are coded as they enter them and there is no extra work on their part.","caldwellmedical.com,trhospital.net,pmhnet.com,bayoubendhealth.org,gibsonhospital.org,yahoo.com,att.net,artesiageneral.com,bmh.org"

Note on current functionality: Discharge orders may be marked to ""Print to the Discharge Instructions"" in the setup of the Nursing Order. These orders may also be pulled into an Order Set to indicate (via Header) which orders will print to the patient document. This eliminates the need for re-entering in a flowchart.

Nikki Csiki Oct 18, 2023
Discharge Instructions: The issue with the flowchart discharge instructions when populated from order entry is that that are terribly formatted, not cleanly categorized, and not user friendly. Additionally, if a provider places any d/c orders outside of the coded orders from an order set, the patient may not receive those instructions.


Discharge Summary: These are required provider-created Notes, and providers are constantly forced to manually list their discharge orders in the note -- essentially they enter them as orders then enter them again in the discharge summary. If they could enter them once as orders, and those orders could populate both a discharge summary and discharge instructions via filter, it would be a win-win.

Michelle Mason Oct 23, 2023
I see. So, you're looking at the Discharge Instructions nursing document or a Note? Either way, there is no actual ""translation"" that takes place in the system currently. Patient Education documents are either available in another language or not. Discharge instructions are not static like education documents.

sphilip@brunswickhospitalcenter.org Oct 23, 2023
We are also looking for discharge instructions. I don't think it needs to be static for the language translator to work. Language translators accept dynamic content. In the case of patient education, the Evident application is pulling from another document library. It is not performing any translation.

Michelle Mason Oct 23, 2023
Thank you. You are correct. We currently do not have a translator. We provide content that has been translated via Clinical Knowledge.

A translator engine would be the ""dream"" part of this idea. I need to clarify where you would want that to work.","brunswickhospitalcenter.org,yahoo.com,kingmanhc.com,artesiageneral.com"

Michelle Mason Oct 18, 2023
You can certainly use the same order set for both current and Future orders; however, the provider will have to select Future Orders before adding those orders and process them separately. A header reminding them to select Future Orders before selecting orders below that line might be beneficial.

Susan Gutjahr Oct 18, 2023
Opposite direction Michelle. We are in an order set on the Hospital Side as we discharge a patient and we want to build in future order seamlessly so the provider can order the follow-up outpatient testing/services the patient needs post discharge.

2. I would like to know the # of new patient enrollments/registrations during a given month.
3. I would like to know the # of existing users that actually then log in to the portal each month or for a given time period.
4. As a stretch, it would be nice to know the most frequency used features within MCC.

Mark Boomhower Jul 26, 2024
I totally agree with the need for this differentiation in the description seen in a Notes template. In our ER the providers often open their Note template BEFORE the nurse is done triaging the patient as they often go in and speak to the patient at the same time. This means in most cases the filter will say No Home Meds Available and they have to refresh the filter once the nurse confirms the meds. But if the patient truly has no home meds, the filter should at least update to reflect that's the case.

Rick Tobias Jul 29, 2024
Since it's very possible a provider may open a Note template before nurses have addressed Home Meds, the Home Med filter could display ""Home Meds Not Addressed"" as a clear indication of the Med Reconciliation status.

I can see this being useful as well. In addition to what is described above and in Jennifer's comment, expanding it's use to nurses for the MAR when there's specific instructions/directions to follow prior to administration would be handy. It might be a better way to accomplish the need for more room when entering extended comments about the preparation/administration of specific medications.

With a max dose of 4000 mg and a warning at 75%, the nurse administering the medication containing Acetaminophen would receive a warning when the dose will exceed 3000 mg. Once the dose will exceed the max dose of 4000 mg, the user is required to enter an Override Reason before they can update the medication. They are warned with scanning/clicking but cannot update without a reason.

monicas@cozadhealthcare.com Oct 30, 2023
Michelle, I want to be able to hard stop at 4000mg not override. Overriding a 4000mg limit is a safety risk. 3000mg has been the upper limit since 2011 and 4000mg is the absolute upper limit. I do not want our patients going over that.

Michelle Mason Oct 30, 2023
I agree that the safest option would be to prevent administration during bar code scanning; however, we cannot assume that the medication is being scanned and has not already been given.

If we were to not allow documentation of an event that occurred, the administered amount would not be included in the 24-hour count for future administrations of medications including acetaminophen. In that case, the potential safety consideration is higher to not allow the documentation.

Are you proposing a change in the wording of the current Exceeding Maximum Dosage Alert? Should overrides be required for the Threshold Alert Warning? Should both alerts and overrides pull to the Medication Warnings and Override report for monitoring?

Kelsey Drouhard Oct 31, 2023
What about being able to set up witness for a dose warning??

Michelle Mason Oct 31, 2023
Per OP:

Could this be something that could be turned on or off at the discretion of the facility? In the scenario I propose, there would need to be two limits (a soft and a hard), not actually a threshold. 3000mg is the published max per the company, but the absolute max is 4000mg per established data. In that type of situation, overrides should be required past 3000mg.

If both alerts and overrides could pull to the Warnings and Override report that would definitely aid in monitoring the situation. Currently, the report is very difficult to read.","cozadhealthcare.com,lgh-jena.org,yahoo.com,kingmanhc.com,desotoregional.com"

Will that display on the nurse's initial view or only display on the MedAct (provider's view)? There are 2 different views, but it seems that the nurse's view is extremely limited in what can be seen. So if it's just KG, instead of lbs, that would be helpful.

Lori Luciano Nov 9, 2023
We just had a discussion about this at my EHR Committee meeting. With Communication Center, There is not the ability to enter in the date of document.

Now Providers are upset that they cannot tell the dates of EKGs and other documents entered via Communication Center. Then the providers discovered that in Clinical history, they cannot see the date of the previously entered EKGs in that Clinical History Versus Reports and Attachments. They asked me WHY WOULD I WANT TO SEE THE SCANNED DATE? The providers reacted with NOW I HAVE TO DO TO 2 LOCATIONS! Meaning reports & attachments where they can see the previous EKGs with dates of document and the C/H for the newly added EKGs and etc. This need to be resolved soon.

I agree with Lori's comments. All outside records need to show the date of service not, the date they were added to the system in clinical history. Communication Center should have the same functionality and allow the date to be changed to the correct date of service.

dnewby@prmc.org Mar 7, 2024
Yes it still needs to be somewhere, but the scanned in date could still be in an audit record like it is in EFM. I don't think it needs to be clinical history for clinical staff to see all the time. If it's always visible in a second column it's just going to cause confusion on which date they are supposed to look at.

Thank you for your input. I do have a few additional questions regarding the above request.

1. I'd like to confirm you would like to be able to do this on both Non-IV and IV medications without creating a new order (utilizing the original order number)?
2. Would you like the ability to be able to make this change during Order Verification or just with existing orders?
3. Regarding the scheduled time for administration - I would like to confirm you are referring to the First Dose date/time and Start date/time, not the times associated with the frequency?
4. Any additional details you can provide on what functionality you'd like to see is greatly appreciated!

kritter@gcmc.org Dec 6, 2023
1. Yes, there is a benefit for both. For instance, Toradol, is a ""non-IV"" medication because it is IVP.
2. I could see the benefit for both ways. If it wasn't recognized with order verification it would be beneficial for it to be updated before the first administration. We have remote pharmacy, who verify our orders before we can get to the nursing verification, which then does not allow any change.
3. Yes.

Just to update this: The Faxage roll out at our facility has not been successful, due to the lack of functionality compared to Updox. Even in HIM, our users would prefer to use Updox and download and upload documents, rather than put them right in the chart from Faxage. And like I've mentioned before, with the way the Faxage works and the batch scanning in regard to providers signing documents, our clinic will NOT be moving to Thrive until this is resolved, as it would be a huge backwards move in workflow. Our clinic currently receives all of their faxes electronically through Updox, and can send them right to the provider through the EMR for sign off, without ever printing. In order for that to happen in Thrive, they will have to print everything and batch scan it.

Currently, CPSI's version numbering is inconsistent. For example, if you log into CPSI and go to Special Functions → System Management → Change Management System, there are three different numbers that reference the same version: 210505, 2105.05, and 21.05.05. Ideally, these would all be written the same way.

As an alternative, I believe it would be more useful if they were prepended with the year and month followed by incremental numbers for new versions. For example, the version number 2023.11.000 would tell me that this version of CPSI was released on November 2023 and is the very first version in this month.

This would benefit all department directors who would have context for when an update is/was available just by glancing at the version's number. In the same vein, this style of numbering would help quickly indicate if their system is up to date.

One downside would be the loss of the major.minor scheme that benefits engineers/coders. A workaround could be using a mixture of dates and hierarchies. For example: 2023.11.1.1

Clarify Versions for Different Systems

If you log into Thrive and in the file menu go to Help → About, the version number shown is the Clientware's version, not the system's version. Its label should be ""Clientware Version"", not ""Version"" to reduce any confusion.

In addition, it would be helpful if the following was displayed in this same section:

1. The system's version
2. Brief explanation of version's naming scheme
3. A link to view release notes",itinspired.com,"Paul Hendrix Dec 5, 2023
There is a link to the release notes in Change Management; it is the Details button.

This is appreciated, albeit more difficult to access since Change Management is located behind Special Functions which requires a passcode. I think it would be beneficial to also have this in the Thrive's file menu → Help → About section.

Due to the limitations of the update creation process and other factors, we are limited to XXXX.XX for update numbers. A change was made at the corporate level to change the update to XX.XX.XX in communications, but this cannot be made at the creation and installation level.

Our old EMR had Dividers (much like Image Titles) and you could search or set filters by the divider which made finding something so much easier.

DFE-I-1237,Limit the ability for users to have more than one armband scanned at the same time. ,Medication Management,Default (Unassigned),Product Owner Review,2023-11-21 22:24:10,3,,"This is a patient safety issue.

Currently, in both Thrive UX and TWC users can have more than one armband scanned at the same time. That is, theoretically a nurse could have chart tabs open for all of their patients, have the armband scanned on each, and then go on with their med pass. This negates the safety function built into armband scanning. In a safe system, if one patient's armband was already scanned, scanning a 2nd would kick out the ""scanned"" status of the first.

While no one endorses the workflow of scanning all patient armbands before beginning a med pass, the fact that it is even possible is a problem.

Further, I can easily think of a scenario where this could become an issue even if the nurse wasn't using a ""questionable"" workflow: nurse is in patient A's room preparing meds, gets interrupted for a urgent need in another room, runs out to take care of that patient, scan's patient B's armband to give a med and then goes back to patient A's room but gets distracted along the way and does not change the chart tab back to patient A. Needing to rescan the armband is a critical safety measure that is needed in this case to ensure that the meds are given to the right patient.

The armband time out feature is helpful in preventing some errors that the ability to have multiple armbands scanned at the same time can cause, but is insufficient as the above scenario could happen pretty quickly. It is difficult to find a time short enough to prevent this but still gives the nurse enough time to complete a med pass on a single patient who has a lot of meds.

Ideally, scanning a new armband would kick out the ""scanned"" status of any other armband. Enabling facilities to limit the number of chart tabs that a user can have open at any given time would also be acceptable. Preferably this would be set by role, not by facility.",chomepgh.org,,"chomepgh.org,lgh-jena.org,cmhcare.com"

1. Barcode scanning can only be associated with one medication. For compounded medications that have > 1 medication, clinical monitoring cannot be done.

a. the x ""Creating Non IV Compound Pharmacy items"" recommendation that we ""Enter 99999-9999-99. No clinical monitoring will be received however with this NDC. • Enter the NDC number of the ingredient most likely to cause an allergic reaction"" is completely inadequate.

2. For compounded medications that involve only one medication, concentration and dosage form cannot be verified from scanning
3. Because patient medication leaflets are tied to the NDC, incorrect or incomplete leaflets are generated for compounded medications that have > 1 med
4. Because medication reconciliation is tied to the NDC, incomplete or incorrect information pulls during the med rec process.

Recommendation: the NDC needs to be included in barcode scanning so that clinical monitoring can be done, but it cannot be the only option. There needs to be additional setup so that multiple NDCs can be associated with the same barcode, for meds like a GI cocktail where there are multiple ingredients. There also needs to be additional setup so that a non-NDC barcode number can be generated for scanning that is tied to the NDC for clinical monitoring. We need to be able to adjust the dosage form and concentration for these meds so that two meds that have the same ""parent"" med do not come across as the same med during scanning.",chomepgh.org,,"cozadhealthcare.com,yahoo.com,chomepgh.org,taylorregional.org"

We have many patients with a modified code, ""No shock, CPR okay"" or ""No CPR, medication/shock okay"" , ""CPR/Medication only"" There are many variation possibilities, we would like to reflect the actual code status of our patients.

Kristan Michaud Feb 14, 2024
We need options for DNR/DNI and Comfort Measures Only to also reflect the ordered code status for patients. The 4 hard coded options currently available do not meet all potential code status options which could lead to errors in patient care in a potential code situation.

Stephanie Yoder Feb 25, 2024
Agreed, the new functionality to update the code status via order entry is a great concept, but the options to choose are the same from the code status drop down menu in demographics.
I would like to see a free text field in the code status dropdown area in nursing order set up that will pull to the demographics code status.

sara downing Mar 11, 2024
Modified code is used frequently, if you aren't going to expand for multiple options, the least you could have is modified code so they can look deeper in the chart for the full code status. This can lead to running incorrect code when all the details are not readily available for staff to see.

Clayton Eagerton May 16, 2024
We are having the same issue as well. Our providers need the options for DNR/DNI and comfort measures. If we could have the ability to add options that would be ideal. Our current workaround is just having a miscellaneous nursing order for them to free text the code status.

Lexie Tulak Jul 11, 2024
We need the code status options to reflect Ohio codes. DNR-CC DNR-CCA and the like. We can't use this function as it is now and have to tell staff to ignore the ""assume full code"" on the ID panel. This could be a major safety issue.

Stephanie St. Andrie Jul 15, 2024
We have an item to work on for placing an order for Modified Code Status. This will allow the provider to select which life saving measures the patient does or does not want used on them. The life-saving measures are Chest Compressions, Defibrillation, Intubation and ACLS medications and the provider will be able to choose more than one of these measures during Order Entry. With this change, we are also adding a new Code Status of DNR-Comfort Care.

Currently the only way to find if Medical Necessity is performed is to go to the ancillary screens and select Medical Necessity OR Medical Records and then Medical Necessity/ABN.

We have not received the notes update yet, but I am now dreading it. I am going to have to rebuild many templates. The documentation platforms in CPSI are so limited or function poorly and here is yet another limitation. I have also been told that the default option for a list phrase has also been removed. These two programming changes are going to make a lot of our templates obsolete. I have recently built new templates for our wound care clinic that provides care to several reoccurring outpatients that are seen up to three times a week. It contains several tables with each field containing a phrase list. Each row is for a different date so the clinician can easily track a wound's progression. Their workflow would be to document that visit, sign the note, and the next visit they copy forward the last note and use the next row. Unfortunately, as you know those text phrases act as anchors and the document cannot be signed if they are not addressed. As a work around I had to create one option that was an underscore and set it as default. That way those empty rows/cells that contain text phrases for future dates appear blank and the note can be signed. If the default option and copy forward function have been removed then these notes will be completely nonfunctional and obsolete. There is going to be so much typing without the dropdowns that it will not be time efficient. Needless to say I haven't even published the wound templates because now I am back to square one. I really hope the product owner reevaluates these changes.

Yes, this needs a different solution for sure. In this scenario, the easiest fix is changing the name when you are looking them up. Also, when going to a profile(not when adding as a contact), it would state at the top 'Patient' 'Emergency Contact' 'Guarantor'. There are times when all 3 may display. But if they have missing info like an address on the profile, we can see that it is only in our system as an Emergency Contact. I don't hate the idea of changing it to free text and typing the patient name and phone number. It would be much easier for staff to update it. We also have scenarios: a coworker in town and their daughter who lives out of town. So they have 2 contacts, but we have no place to chart that.

Hello Carlos,

I'm interested in exploring the possibility of using the Notes application as a platform for creating an order template. We're facing several limitations with our current order set or OE question system. For example, we're unable to construct tables, and our dropdown options are quite restricted.

This potential template holds promise for streamlining the process for providers. If feasible, how might nurses utilize the template for TORB entry? Do you have any sample templates that we could review? Additionally, what legal and security considerations should we take into account before moving forward with this approach?

CPOE presents a warning for all categories of duplicate orders - many of these are unnecessary warning/stops/clicks for the user/provider leading to alert fatigue.

Based on their recommendations, there is potential for improved safety features and reduced alert fatigue regarding duplicate alerts. Having a discussion with your user groups is a great place to start.

▪ Therapeutic duplication checking that occurs before new medication orders are submitted (e.g., two orders for the same or two different beta-blockers are placed) is carefully implemented and monitored. Note that there are situations where it is clinically indicated to prescribe duplicate therapies. For example, duplicate alerts should NOT fire for an order for an IV bolus, followed by an order for a continuous drip of the same medication.

▪ There are rules to determine how and when diagnostic tests or procedures receive duplicate checking before they are ordered. - I believe there could be improvements in the duplicate checking/notifications for ancillary services.

▪ Duplicate checking does not include PRN (i.e., as needed) medication orders. - currently when duplicate therapy checking is turned on, it does not exclude PRN meds.

As a client they should be able to link to/see our documentation on situations and very clearly outlined: Sit #; Last Action; Status; Next Steps; Owners; and Dates. I believe this is what myCPSI was supposed to be but it would need higher functionality.
Internally we need to limit the amount of time we waste chasing down the appropriate contacts and repeating information/updating each new team member. We need
1)	 A functional Agile directory
2)	 A common platform (Client portal) for Communication, Transparency, and Coordination between CPSI teams internally and with Clients


a.	Client should be able to see or link to current sits and issues that concern their facility with:
i.	Sit #
ii.	Description
iii.	Issue Status
iv.	Last Action
v.	Next Steps
vi.	Owners
vii.	(Possible color code for sits without documentation in the past 48-72hours)

viii. Client's should be able to prioritize these issues by facility preference.

iX. For corporate facilities there should be an option to combine facility lists and prioritize at a corporate level.

X. An option to organize situations by functionality for ease of departments for both CPSI/Facilities


b.	Internal employees should be able to see a facility situation list with all the information above and add documentation to that issue.
i.	Consideration of having internal documentation with only select information that could draw to the client visibility to maintain concise communication.

Michelle Mason Jan 31, 2024
Can you be more specific on what you man by ""clean up""? Are you suggested outdated drop downs be hidden?

Lori Luciano Feb 1, 2024
I am dreaming but I would like to hide dropdowns no longer in use also. But I would really like the eform dropdowns to function like the notes phrases lists. Can add, edit, remove and the changes would not affect the eforms. Now if you delete a dropdown selection and then someone goes to the back to that eform that selection is blank on the form. The eform should save the selection regardless of what has occurred in the dropdown list.

Sarah Blazier Feb 1, 2024
I believe they mean when creating dropdown lists you could make either an entry within that drop down 'inactive' so it will not appear for the user. Or make an entire list 'inactive' so that when you are building an eform and want to add a new dropdown list - you aren't looking through old unused lists. Similar to order sets - you can mark them inactive so that you can filter them out quickly.

Sara Kress Feb 6, 2024
I agree with Sarah B. That would be optimal - inactivate an entry, then I wouldn't have 14+ dropdowns with the number behind them. At this point we would need to be able to Inactivate the old lists also. If we have imported eforms from the library, we can inactivate those dropdowns that pulled in also.

Janna Sartin Sep 5, 2024
My idea is when you edit a version 1 e-form it creates the e-form being edited as version 2 under construction. When version 2 is set live then it sets version 1 automatically as obsolete. It would be nice if the Drop Downs would function the same way. When edited any documentation using that drop down in the past would have that version 1 kept safe. When the edited dropdown is saved it sets version 1 as obsolete and version 2 is used in the future.","prmc.org,pomerenehospital.org,gh-health.org,rch-lyons.com,upmc.edu,legenthealth.com,yahoo.com,foresthealth.com,bhsh.com,ajmchc.org,madriverhospital.com,lapazhospital.org,kingmanhc.com,hss-mi.org,monroesurgical.com,wcmhosp.org,girardmedicalcenter.com,bayoubendhealth.org,gordonmemorial.org,cmhcare.com,cranememorial.org"

Issues with TTY's are compounded when facilities use VDI applications like Horizons VM Ware since users are assigned sessions randomly from a pool every time they log in and it's like logging into a new device. Because of this, they also need to install ThriveHelper with each new session. In the process of going through the steps so System menu can be utilized, users are asked for their Terminal ID. The only way they can find it is if they're savvy enough to open TUX and go to System Menu> Thrive UX > Options > Misc > Terminal ID.


To avoid going through this ""ritual"" every time they log into TWC, it makes more sense for the TTY to be assigned on the user login profile (UBL). If it's assigned to the log in, then the TTY should automatically load in the user account settings in TWC.

Our workaround is to have the machine name of each thin client end with an appropriate 3 digit number. Then when a user signs on a script will pill the last 3 numbers from the machine name and populate their tty.

Additionally we had to install the ThriveHelper on our golden image with each update to save all of our users from the repeated prompts to install ThriveHelper.

It's been quite a bit of trial and error just to get to this point...and I find it to be very unprofessional when CPSI employees call my boss to help out another facility to work out these scripts. We're not even getting any kickbacks or discounts for supporting their customers. :(

1. The Sexual Orientation Effective Date will no longer highlight in red after a date has been cleared and re-entered. This has been resolved on both the Social History - All and Social History - Sexual sections.

I agree. The split screen is way too small. Been wanting to put this idea in here but just haven't gotten around to it. Everyone double clicks these days to get something to open.

Angela Plummer Apr 10, 2024
I agree! I know in our facility it is just instinct to double click. Users have enough to be frustrated on how the screen views are (Notes on a laptop-not user friendly at all) - at least let them pick their double click view choice, instead of making them wait for it to the split screen to load (all the while they are clicking the view button 20 times). Was this tested on a laptop with a user with aging eyes?? Not that they NEED to have aging eyes to NOT like the split screen view because trust me I have young eyed users complain plenty about this too.

Michelle Mason Apr 23, 2024
If you double click the document, you get the Document Viewer. If you single click and select View, it opens full screen.

Felicia McDonel Apr 24, 2024
Thanks Michelle but we are requesting the double click to be the full screen. Most testing is done on larger computer screens but the workflow for a nurse is on a much smaller screen which are small to read and the less clicks the better.

Michelle Mason Apr 24, 2024
I wanted to be sure the current functionality was understood. How do you see this working? If double click opens full screen, would the View option open the Document Viewer?

Heather Sears Apr 24, 2024
Personally I feel like the split screen could be omited. No one can see properly on the split screen open. When I double click it, I feel like it should bring it up large enough to read. If it was an ""all or nothing"" option, I would want the full screen option only.

Felicia McDonel Apr 24, 2024
I agree with Heather. Double click to bring up the full screen option. I would take away the document viewer option. It is too small. I would leave the option to check multiple documents at a time for viewing.

Sara Kress Apr 24, 2024
I agree with Heather and Felicia. In TUX the functionality is double click opens the document to full screen. So they continue to double click with a different outcome in TWC. It is difficult to find a monitor large enough to make the document viewer an option.

DFE-I-1410,NOTES: System Filters are extended past the Page margins,Notes,Default (Unassigned),In Development,2024-01-25 17:04:47,45,,"When a note is signed it goes through a PDF conversion whereby the conversion process will auto shrink the entire note proportionately until the note content fits within the PDF page margins.

Currently, several of our System Notes filters, predominately Vital Signs and Demographics, contain too many columns to fit within the page margins resulting in a PDF that has small content and sometimes too small to be usable and readable. And since the System Filters cannot be modified by the users but are popular in their usage since the are always shown on the notes default screen, this causes many situations to be entered complaining about too small text on PDFs. The only course of action open to the customer is to then edit the note on each individual patient and modifying the text to be within margins and/or manually modify the filter table until it either they remove enough columns to fit or adjust the table width to fit. Adjusting the table width will still not resolve this issue if there are too many columns.


As a company, we need to make sure that ALL of our System Filters do fit within the page margins of the note when used so that we do not contribute to this issue of ""shrunken"" notes documents.",evident.com,"Alica Bell Feb 22, 2024
This problem within the default tables needs to be escalated as a high priority fix. The providers are relying on all tables to fit within the proper margins of a standard piece of paper when a note needs to be printed and sent with any transitions of care or patient referrals. The last thing on their mind is taking the time to make sure pre defined tables supplied by the EHR vendor meets the standard margin requirements. This is a HUGE PATIENT SAFETY CONCERN and needs to be addressed ASAP. When the default provided tables exceed the margin parameters the PDF conversion to print said document shrinks the whole document to fit the within the margins. By doing this to get the pre defined table to fit the page the rest of the text document shrinks as well making the text so mall you need a magnifying glass to interpret the text. Once again these are default predefined programed tables that we are using and is creating a huge patient safety concern. Please fix it ASAP. Providers are relying on the efficiency of the notes application and don't have the time to format documentation that should be formatted by the EHR vendor and programmers.

Pam Rowley Feb 27, 2024
This is a real problem for us as well. We had to build a custom Vital Signs: Simple table that had fewer data elements. However the ""big"" Vital Signs table is still available for the providers to select, and they do. Please fix this. Our providers do not have the time to worry about which table they should select so that their notes are not compressed.

How many votes does it take to advance this issue and get it resolved? This issue has been going on for a long time now with no results as to it being fixed. Providers do not or will not take the time to select a different table when this one still populates as the preferred default table. Customer satisfaction and patient safety should be your priority. It needs to be fixed ASAP. All tables should fall under the correct page margins. This should not even have been an issue to begin with the standard page is 8 1/2 X 11 with 1 inch margins. I'm pretty sure even programs know this.

Yes! This is also true for the notes templates with filters! Our providers that see the subacute patients are having a hard time documenting a simple progress note because it seems the filters are trying to pull all data before filtering it to show in the note. We resorted to removing the filters from the templates completely and the provider has to search or calculate the information to enter manually.

The provider discontinued approx. 12 of them on the discharge med rec so the patients home med list should have 18 medications on it. However, the CCDA that was sent out to the patients PCP showed all 30 medications on it. The only way to know that the 12 dcd meds were old was if you happened to look at the ""End Date"" and decide that the end date of January 2024 means that those meds are discontinued and all the ""UNKNOWNS"" are the active meds.

This was brought to our attention when a receiving facility office for the patient's PCP called our hospital to clarify the patients medication list.

My suggestion is that the Home medication list be JUST the current medication list. We generate a new CCD each visit so why do we need old trash on the most up to date CCD? This list is confusing and I can't say that I would have seen that end date line and left those off if I received this list from a patient or facility. It's just not good. What we send out to other facilities should be clear, concise, accurate information for the patient.

OR could the dcd meds be sorted into their own list below and clearly defined as such?

Tom,

When in the scheduler event screen for an appointment, there is a field on the left side of the screen under Chief Complaint titled Insurance. This must be filled in so that we can check eligibility in patient connect. When a patient is a self pay/private pay, we direct staff to enter a P in this field. However, when doing that, we get a pop up message ""Thrive coverage does not exit on the profile."" The system requires that we go to the right of the Event screen and add Insurance P Private Pay. When we do this it causes the billing office problems that they have to manually fix. We want to be able to put a P in the Insurance on the event without having to add the P to the insurance on the profile.

Prompt for Duplicate Orders for Ancillary Items During CPOE and OE

Software Change: When placing a duplicate order of ancillary items from CPOE or OE, users can now receive a prompt notifying them that it is a duplicate order. The prompt reads, ""Duplicate Order Warning. This item was previously ordered on [date/time]. Do you still want to order this item?"" Users will need to select Yes or No to close the prompt and proceed.

This prompt is not enabled by default. To enable it for your facility, see the setup instructions below.

Set Up Required: To enable the duplicate order prompt for OE, turn on the Use Duplicate Order Prompt switch in the POC Control Maintenance Table, page 1.

To enable it for CPOE, turn on the Use Duplicate Order Prompt switch in the ChartLink Control Table, page 3.

We treat numerous pediatric patients and this brought the design to our attention but what we are going to share and recommend goes for pediatrics and adults.


1. Phone: Profile/Visit: The phone # entered here drives the phone # that pulls to a new request in Communication, Chart Communication.
2. Cell Phone: Profile/Visit: The Cell Phone # entered drives the number that will get appointment reminders.

REQUEST:

1.

a. For both of these phone #, please provide a way for us to add context as to who this phone # belongs to. icon to click to add with hover to view maybe. I know space is tight.
b. This will also allow us to know if we are calling a parent (which one), guardian, etc or if we have the patient's phone # that we are calling because the type of visit/results requires we talk directly to the patient vs parent/guardian.

Mother/Father Contact Numbers

Although I would like to recommend an overhaul of the contact # capture, I am only asking below for what I hope are simple additions to visibility in alternate screens of the numbers that are already being captured in the system from a clerical and clinical need.

1. Profile - Contact/Billing Info - choose the Father profile and the Mothers profile and attach to the child. There is no way to see their phone # from this view. REQUEST #1 - show the phone # here or have them be a hover over.
2. Visit - Census, Contact - the Father and Mother again show but no abiltiy to see their phone numbers. REQUEST #2 - show their phone # here or have them be a hover over or replace the birthplace with phone #.
3. Chart, visit - Communication, Chart Communication, New Request - pulls the Phone # from the profile - not from the visit - the provider has no idea who that phone # belongs to and who they are calling. REQUEST #3 - add any context you can around this phone #. If the request is entered from a call then we ask the called the # but when entered by adding a note to a result, it auto pulls the phone # and there needs to be more context for the provider/nurse who is returning the call.
4. Chart, Demographics, Personal - the Father/Mother do not display on this screen with their phone # - REQUEST #4 - add them here.
5. Chart, Demographics, Personal, Contacts - can only see the name and relationship Father, Mother, etc but not their phone/cell #. REQUEST #5 - add them to this screen for quick access.",spartahospital.com,,"lgh-jena.org,pchsgrant.com,yahoo.com,nrmchealth.com,spartahospital.com,cmhcare.com"

The situation is that I am not able to run a report that will display what is written in line 21 and give to the department in fault. So, when a department has multiple accounts with comments in line 21, I have to open up each account and let the department know what the issue is. In the M/R Bill report, there is a column for communications that comes from the Insurance tab in Patient Functions but we reserve that for our coders to communicate to us. The M/R Bill report does pull the last entered location for that chart.

An idea/suggestion would be for a report such as the M/R Bill Report to pull the information from line 21. This would save the Analyst/Coordinator time by not needing to open each account.

We verbally shared this and then via email to Monica McCaskey in January.


Listed below are some changes that we see at this time that would be helpful to the end user workflow.

1. A go/start button so that filters can be set and then the system searches to load the accounts rather than loading all accounts immediately. To get around this now we created a Search filter that looks for a stay type we don't use and auto checked it so nothing loads until we set our filters and uncheck the dummy search filter. Once this is added then please make the filters sticky.
2. We have coders that work in both facilities during the day. A Drop-down box to change between facilities (0001 sparta community hospital and 0004 quality healthcare) would help facilitate changing facilities quicker. It is not convenient to log out of one facility and then have to log in to the other.
3. Have a drop-down box like coding status to be able to filter and choose multiple providers or service codes - similar to how Patient Connect works to multi-select providers, etc.
4. Refresh button to refresh screen to update list. Have an account auto fall off the list when it coding is complete.
5. For easier access to the coding status button have the status button moved.

a. Ability to change status of chart while in HIM coding list screen.
b. add the coding status change button to submenu ribbon on the coding patient summary tab to the right of Edit or Charged CPT.

6. We have created numerous Visit filters and they need to wrap to a second line rather than vertically wrap.
7. add ability to change chart location from within the coding list vs having to go to medical records.",spartahospital.com,,"spechosp.com,wchnh.org,tsjh.org,ajmchc.org,pmhnet.com,lgh-jena.org,westholtmed.org,ahmchealth.com,pchsgrant.com,yahoo.com,nrmchealth.com,eomchospital.com,hrrmc.net,wcmhosp.org,spartahospital.com,burgesshc.org"

What report is that?

Shellie Brooks Apr 10, 2024
I agree. The nurses and providers could not put in a Solu-Medrol order at the beginning of April, because the cpt code expired March 31, 2024. Thankfully, I was here to change the code and put the order in from the Pharmacy side, but after hours, this is a nightmare. I have gotten called back, because an ER doctor (and the nurses) couldn't put in a med because the cpt expired. Most rural hospitals don't have a person that can sit around and update the formulary every single day.

Tracie Bastien Apr 10, 2024
we were unaware of this issue until it happened to us at the beginning of April as well. There were no clearly defined resources or warnings that these CPT codes were expiring, at least we had no idea. If this is an expectation that we maintain all the CPT code updates for pharmacy, then there should be a report we can run to see which ones might be expiring soon and a resource we can go to get the updated ones. I thought CPT codes updated with certain maintenance patches. I had never had to do this before. It stalled patient care.

Jamie Johnson Apr 12, 2024
I agree this should not be a hard stop. This disrupts patient care. Nursing or providers are not responsible for maintaining CPT codes so why does it hard stop on their side? If the program is able to recognize the expired CPT code why can there not be a report or notice when CPT codes are expiring. Often these are published in a single spot or easy to find and often can be in the future. An alert would be nice but not a hard stop.","wardmemorial.com,midcoasthealthsystem.org,doctorsmemorial.com,jackhosp.org,trubridge.com,emanuelmedical.org,chmcok.com,ajmchc.org,pmhnet.com,lgh-jena.org,bayoubendhealth.org,surgeonschoice.com,ahmchealth.com,gh-health.org,fallonmedical.org,pchsgrant.com,mhtcg.com,yahoo.com,att.net,mckenziehealth.org,kingmanhc.com,nchnet.org,alhnet.org"

We use med verify in every place we can to ensure we keep patients safe. This means that more than the routine nursing department uses the application. We have other departments (identified by a unique department number) such as IV therapy, at least five clinics, surgery etc. that use med verify as well.

ISSUE: For both the med verify report by patient and med verify report by employee, you cannot drill down to see specific department use of med verify. You get every med verify entry from every area using med verify for the selected date range. This is a very messy data lump and not really helpful.

The reports (report dashboard templates) do not have the advanced options to filter out (or in) what you need to report on.

EX: I only want to see med verify compliance for department 020 (routine services) for a time period.

I know you can take the data, dump into excel, then either sort/filter or bring in other elements to make the complete report. This takes to long to get a meaningful report.

This is the one step report we want: For a time range, all med verify use that occurred on Routine Nursing Services.


We are also seeing a need to expand the reporting so that we can monitor med verify by stay type and sub type.

EX: For a time range and department routine services all type 1 accounts with a sub type of XX and a service code of ZZ. Or even for a time range and department routine services all type 1 accounts with a service code of ZZ.

A solution would be to add the Advanced Option to both reports. I can create my report parameters and save them. When I need the data, load the saved report and change the data parameters. The advanced options should include a section for patient demographic elements. It might even want to include a medication section to get specific medication elements.


Path to reports: All paths take you to report dashboard. Easiest way is login WebClient - report dashboard - find the two reports. You can only run based on output and time range and a sort only on one version of the report.

Bottom Line. We want to know our med verify compliance numbers for a single department. We only want to see that one department. Then within that department, dig deeper using patient demographic elements to query for that information. here may even be a need to include medication information as well. Antibiotics, med verify compliance for scheduled medications. We do not want to be limited in selecting the data we want. .",bmh.org,"Michelle Mason Apr 15, 2024
Thank you for your idea. One thing you can do to immediately see the Med Verify for a single department is to use the ""Search"" box in the top, right of the Med Verify Compliance Report by Patient.

Clarification regarding links to content on TruLearn (as opposed to TruBridge Client Center):

When logging into TruLearn, please be sure that you are using the new URL for the site: https://learn.trubridge.com/

If you are logged in using the old CPSIQ address (cpsi.docebosaas.com), it does not automatically redirect to the new URL. All links provided in Access should be using the new learn.trubridge.com address, so if you are logged in with the old URL it will take you to the sign-on page for the new site, even if you are logged in with the old one.

Some documents/links shared in the Access that are located within TruLearn will require a login but you should be directed to that document/page after logging in. You should remain logged in to TruLearn for that window session until logged out. I do believe there is an inactivity time period that will force you to log in again but you should only need to log in once a day (unless you're logging out of TruLearn and/or your window session). We do test links prior to the Access going out and if we have already logged in to TruLearn and select a link from the Access, it opens directly to the document/page. Please reach out to me directly if you encounter this issue again - kayla.granberry@trubridge.com.

I was told that if there is some sort of statutory/regulatory requirement, CPSI has to oblige and make it happen (without charging us for the update). I just haven't found the a statute/regulatory requirement that I can provide them with, yet.... Because participation in ABS is technically not a requirement since your facility can opt to not participate I guess.

Nikki Csiki May 1, 2024
Hi Bonnie, I appreciate your comment! You are correct that there is not a direct regulatory dictate that declares duration to be required. Duration, however, is a de facto requirement for antimicrobial stewardship participation as you noted. It is also evidence-based best practice, with large volumes of literature supporting the critical nature of appropriate duration of antimicrobial therapy. Additionally, now that AUR is tied to Promoting Interoperability (ability to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs, i. e. huge potential financial loss for non-compliance) the requirement is more direct. Some NHSN AUR key metrics are dependent on the all-important duration, such as calculation of defined daily doses (DDD) and standardized antimicrobial administration ratio (SAAR).

I would say to TruBridge, please do better. The data exists to support enablement of required duration functionality for antimicrobial orders. So much of the infrastructure already exists (discrete field, already-classified antimicrobial items, similar functionality elsewhere in pharmacy item set up); I cannot believe it would be an extraordinary expense or effort to bring this functionality to fruition.

The links below are only a tiny fraction of the available literature/professional organization recommendations for duration of antimicrobial therapy. TruBridge, I would be happy to answer any questions you have, as would my pharmacy director.

Right now I end up going to Move File, type the same account number, select a reason and then rename it, which is a lot of extra steps than just right clicking on something and click on rename.

jhansen@dchbenkelman.com May 20, 2024
Perkins Co Hospital came up with a workaround. It's a lot of clicks, but it doesn't involve printing.

1. Select the document in System Menu>Choose patient/date of service>Electronic File Management.
2. Select the document.
3. Click on the change icon, taskbar, upper right.
4. Select Move File.
5. Type in the same account number, enter, and click OK.
6. Choose Wrong Image Title.
7. Click the SAVE icon.
8. It will then pop up and let you rename the document.

Thanks to Pam Rowley at Perkins County for sharing.

I asked this question a few months ago. There is a report but it is located in Special Functions under Physician Order Log Data Report. It is also in an area of the system where we don't all need access to. I had to get my administrator to pull it for me. I found that all the lab orders that are entered in the Lab module go in as written. There is no way to change this. If there is a lab order that is verbal or protocol such as a reflex or Type/Match for blood, you cannot select protocol or verbal. This makes the report not accurate. It looks like all those are written orders.

Then the next time you go in and there are new results, only the new results will be highlighted again, drawing your attention to those new results, and then when you acknowledge them, again, the highlighted color will go away.

This doesn't address the problem that there isn't an easy way to see who and when a lab was signed off. This is a medical-legal issue. There needs to be a way to have a timestamp as to when you signed off AND see that in the patient's labs. Running a report doesn't meet that need.

We need to see exactly what was acknowledged. The only thing the alert audit report shows is a date and if it was summarized lab results for example but doesn't say it was a CBC, CMP, and Hemoglobin A1C for example. We need to know specifics.

bfehringer@stantoncountyhospital.com Jun 5, 2024
Yes, I agree with Linda, we need to know specifically which lab results were acknowledged/reviewed, by who, and when (date/time). For frontline staff, who do not usually run reports such as this, it would be great if this functionality was from the lab app in the chart. And again, it would be great if new labs were highlighted a color until they are acknowledged. It helps frontline staff/clinical staff/providers recognize the new lab results that they need to review and acknowledge.

murrayhall@mitchellcountyhospital.com Aug 21, 2024
When CMS comes in the facility, they first thing they will ask is show me that the provider acknowledged the lab test results (loop closure). From my experience, I don't think the alert audit report is detailed enough. I know healthland had a report that showed each test that was acknowledged, but the inspectors did not really like it. They really want to see the time date stamp when you hover over the test or on the PDF report. They will probably write us up not being able to produce a report or show the time date stamp for a test(s). We know that the providers have to acknowledge the labs, but you are missing the whole purpose of the acknowledgement button if we cannot see when it was acknowledged.","mitchellcountyhospital.com,nrmchealth.com,stantoncountyhospital.com"

Then when the patient arrives for their MRI, if the clerk doesn't catch that the 99999 provider is still there, it will cross into our PACS with the wrong provider and this can cause problems with the provider not getting the report autofaxed to them.

I would like to have a fourth option that will allow me to turn off or block a field that I don't want to use or allow registration to enter data into.

Since the profile was originally built for clinics and migrated to the hospital environment, there is some logic that doesn't always make sense for us.

One example we struggle with is the Physician field on the Demographics tab of the Profile. This pulls to the attending physician field on a new account and then pulls forward to order entry as the ordering physician by default.

If a patient comes in with orders from a specialist, for example, and the registration clerk doesn't change the attending physician on the new account, then the wrong doctor is listed as the attending/admitting physician. When the order for their CT is placed under the wrong doctor...those results go back to the wrong doctor, not the one who actually wrote the orders.

Chason Hicks Jul 23, 2024
Thanks @guest. I'll post some comments and clarifying questions below!

1) Is the desire to re-order these from the Event builder screen so they show in the correct order in Notes Co-Signature drop down? If we can display these providers in alphabetical order in Notes, without you having to re-order the list of names when you're building the rule, would that be better?

2) This sounds like what you'd like is a way to create an Event Rule, similar to how we have Application and Behavior security? That way you can just take Event Rule ABC and apply it to 15+ providers. Am I understanding the ask correctly?

3) Even when the List Type of ""Logname"" is selected, you should still be able to search for a provider by their name. The Search bar in Logname and Physician List operates the same.

4) This is something we will look into!

Chason Hicks Jul 23, 2024
Hey Lori, are you referring to the Event Builder screen, Step 3, where it lists all the lognames of the previously associated providers?

Sara Kress Jul 23, 2024
I'm not guest, but I can add my opinions.

1. Just customize, most times we want it alphabetical. But some lists I have alpha by physician then alpha by the PA or APRN. And sometimes I want the ortho surgeon first then alpha by the remainder of physicians. If we could reorder after adding them (if we need to add another after the list is created), that would be great.
2. Yes, if we can Just Like or Associate like other Rules have. This is an Event on the Role, but when I turned in a sit, they said the rule only applied to Co-Signers for Order Entry, not Notes. So you set it up exactly the same in both locations but it has different functions.
3. 4. We don't know all of the physicians numbers. If the search would stay sticky (or default it to login user name in stead of ubl login) we could search and add quicker. If it named them after they were in the list, we could know who we have added already and if someone leaves or retires it's easier to remove them. It makes sense that they pull first, last because it is from the UBL login table (they can't cosign if they don't have a login to the system), but last name, first like the physician table would help. We don't address them 'Joe' in the hallway, they are known by their last name in the workplace.

There's no way to search folders by account number or name and results populate the folder as OLDEST to NEWEST with no way to reverse the viewing order. This is a patient safety issue and it's made worse by the fact that there's not a way to filter Micro Culture results from other results. The task ""Summarized Micro Lab Results"" hasn't worked for years now. So everything is lumped into the task ""Summarized Lab Results"". Providers are not going to sort through the folder to find culture results. The process to review culture results, especially with the regulatory requirements for Antimicrobial Stewardship taking affect needs to be greatly improved.

DFE-I-1858,Need Pain re-assessment icon in EDIS notifications on Tracking Board,Tracking Board | Patient Search,Default (Unassigned),Future Development,2024-07-23 12:32:35,2,,"There is a critical patient safety concern regarding the functionality of the Emergency Department Information System (EDIS) currently in use. As it stands, all medication orders in EDIS are automatically designated as one-time STAT orders. This system configuration fails to prompt nurses to perform essential pre-medication pain assessments and does not provide notifications for the necessary reassessment of pain following medication administration.

This gap in functionality poses a significant risk to patient safety, especially given that a substantial number of Emergency Department (ED) patients present with acute pain and require Schedule II or III controlled medications for pain management. Ensuring these patients receive the same standard of care as inpatients is imperative. For inpatients, nurses are prompted at the time of medication administration to do the pre-assessment, and a notification icon appears on the tracking board to alert nurses when a pain reassessment is due. However, this crucial safety feature of pre-medication assessment is absent from the X1 medication orders and the re-assessment notification is not available on the ED tracking board, even when the medication order frequency is adjusted to a PRN (as needed) timeframe.

To address this pressing issue, we urgently need the EDIS to incorporate the following functionalities for all pain medications, regardless of whether they are one-time orders:

1. Pre-Medication Pain Assessment Prompt: Nurses must be prompted to perform a pain assessment before administering pain medications. This ensures that the medication is appropriate for the patient's current pain level and condition.
2. Pain Reassessment Notification: An alert icon should appear on the ED tracking board to remind nurses to reassess the patient's pain following medication administration. This reassessment is crucial to determine the effectiveness of the pain management plan and to make necessary adjustments.

Implementing these features will not only enhance the quality of care provided in the ED but also align the safety standards for ED patients with those for inpatients. The absence of these functionalities can lead to inadequate pain management, delayed reassessment, and potential harm to patients, undermining the overall goal of patient-centered care.

We urge you to prioritize these enhancements in the EDIS to safeguard our patients and ensure that our healthcare providers are equipped with the necessary tools to deliver high-quality, safe, and effective care.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this critical matter. We look forward to your prompt response and action to address these patient safety concerns.",eomchospital.com,"Michelle Mason Jul 23, 2024

Currently the visit information is entered on the resource location which causes problems when the service code is different for different tasks. For example in our Primary care clinics the stay type and subtype is always the same for each resource but the service code and physician can vary. For a nurse visit the physician would depend on who the patients PCP was. Then there are different service codes for clinic visit, transitional care management visit, annual wellness visit, or telehealth visit. One provider conducts all of those types of appointments in one day so as the programming is today each provider would have 4 columns on one clinic schedule which makes scheduling impossible.

On the 4th use have an indicator to staff that this is the last use of this order and it is expiring(or if the order is good for 6 months have the expiration date clearly visible to staff) After all uses or date of expiration then the image is automatically no longer available to attach to future visits and no longer lives on the profile. This should be an automatic process not a manual one. Then since the applicable departments were selected, I would then like a home screen department folder for scanned orders. I would like this to be a workable que in which items could be marked as needing a prior auth- once one user identifies the need for an auth that information should be visible to all users then have a way to mark it as complete and enter the auth # that is again visible to all users. If the image has a reoccurrence that should be easily identified in the folder as well as how many uses are available and or the expiration date of the orders.",fairfaxmed.com,"Melissa Toon Aug 14, 2024
YES - trying to scan outpatient orders to a visit instead of profile is a major patient safety issue. If the patient is registered incorrectly, the ""chain"" is broken and orders will not pull forward so there is a possibility that the order you think is most current is not. You also have to try and figure out where it is - which visit the order is scanned to.

To limit or require that the Morse Fall Risk tool be used in the ambulatory clinic setting is absurd and ridiculous. The Morse Fall Risk tool seems to be specific for inpatient populations asking questions such as IV/Heparin Lock and does not specifically give ideas for preventive measures. Whereas, the STEADI: Fall Risk Assessment specifically has evaluation results which includes the Timed up and Go (TUG) for gait, strength and balance.

As the CMS 139 eCQM states - ""Identifying at-risk patients is the most important part of management, as applying preventive measures...Family physicians have a pivotal role in screening older patients for risk of falls, and applying preventive strategies for patients at risk"".

CMS 139 also states: ""A specific screening tool is not required for this measure, however potential screening tools include the Morse Fall Scale…""which means that by the CMS standard the STEADI: Fall Risk Assessment could be used in the Ambulatory Clinic settings to capture the eCQM requirements in the clinic settings.",artesiageneral.com,"Jackie Cantrell Aug 13, 2024

The STEADI fall screen and TUG Test is more relevant and appropriate to the ambulatory clinic setting than the MFS and patient education materials that support fall prevention are provided to Wellness Visit participants. Although the Morse Fall Screen is used widely in acute care settings, both in the hospital and long-term care inpatient settings and is currently the ONLY fall screen that will map for eCQM in Evident CPSI, it is not efficient to have clinicians perform two fall screenings in the ambulatory clinic setting during time sensitive appointments. My Dream Factory idea is to codify the STEADI fall screen as well, so that quality measures can be captured during ambulatory patient visits and appropriate standing orders for referral to balance training, physical therapy, or further assessment can be developed and utilized if a patient has experienced a fall with injury, multiple falls in the past year, or fails the TUG Test as the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit is designed to address falls, risk for falls, and fall-related injuries in the patient's personalized prevention plan.",artesiageneral.com,"Jackie Cantrell Aug 2, 2024

The Demographic Panel cannot be a catch-all for all things. If there are specific things needed from the ID Panel that do not make sense elsewhere, we would be happy to consider those items. We currently have the Comments option available on the Tracking Board as well as the Right Side navigation bar once a patient is selected to enter/view important information specific to the patient. These Comments can be pinned to pull to each subsequent visit which would be great for 'taking blood pressure on a certain arm, etc'. We are working on adding an indicator to the Comments icon in the Right Side navigation bar so it's easier for an end user to see if comments exist.

Linda Pfeifle Aug 8, 2024
The problem is that unless someone has been admitted, there won't be any comments on a tracking board. That is the problem. If something is added to the clinic tracking board it won't flow over to the hospital tracking board at a later date, will it? Also, sometimes patients will just come in for labs or something and say something about always having something done or someone notified if admitted or something to be aware of. Those are the things we want to pop up so that nurses/providers are aware.

Mark Boomhower Aug 8, 2024
I know the ID panel isn't the answer for everything, but I do understand why there's a need for some things to be shown in the panel from visit to visit. Specifically warnings for staff regarding infectious organisms that place patients in isolation precautions for life, such as CPO Carbapenemase-Producing Organisms, which is highly contagious and carbapenum resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB). These are 2 organisms recognized as urgent health threats by the CDC and could be added to the list of MDRO's that already exists in the ID Panel. If organisms are considered potentially urgent public health risk, then having isolation precautions added at the profile level to cross all accounts should be an option.

Correct. They are double clicking the document and printing but not updating therefore it is not saving in the chart (from New Document).

The system should be updated to require all ingredients to be scanned. For example, a Vancomycin 1750mg would required a 1gm and 750mg vial to compound this product. The system functions currently, if the 1gm vial is loaded on the drug set up first, then only the 1gm vial is needed to scan.

Since these two items are not connected to the account, could they be excluded from the reason that these accounts cannot be deleted. For State & HIE interface purposes, we need to be able to delete these accounts. Changing the admit/discharge dates to 010101 causes issues in the State & HIE systems because when we change the date, it is so old. Because we change these to old dates they filter out these old dates to eliminate bad/old data coming to them so then we get accounts, that show on their end, undischarged.

We had this ability in Centriq, which made it possible for coders to add the procedure code to the Operating Room charge line (360) or the treatment room charge (761) or the CRNA pro fee charge. These charges are not hard coded into the chargemaster with hcpcs codes, as there are multiple possibilities for procedure codes on these charges.


The current workaround is to add a Procedure on the account in Thrive, enter the hcpcs code and tie it to the revenue code. This is very time consuming for the coder, and also is not a complete fix as we still have to touch the facility and pro fee claims in RCM to put the codes in the right place and delete the 0.00 charge lines that it creates.


We have put in several situations for this, and no solution was found, other than the above workaround.",pchsgrant.com,,"wchnh.org,pchsgrant.com,yahoo.com,lgh-jena.org"
