I am guessing it should go to clinical history like it does when you receive a fax. We just need a record of it.

Sends a group message via communication center to a pool of clinic nurses responsible for notifying the patient of their results. All lab results for that account would then be viewable for that nurse in one message along with the providers instructions for the patient. Nurses can communicate via the group as tasks are completed. Send as a Message or Secure Text is available in the abnormal lab results folder but that does not lead to an efficient workflow. If the patient has 5 labs done on that account, then 5 messages would have to be sent which would lead to confusion and inefficiency. Also, when the provider acknowledges the lab and then sends it as either a fax, message, or text is would be helpful if the attached lab included the provider acknowledgement. For example: \"Acknowledged by Dr. Burke on 02/01/2023 at 0956.\" This exchange also needs to be viewable on the patient account similar to chart communication.

Comm Center Mailbox will likely replace Chart Communication. Although I believe this is a step in the right direction, I want to make sure it is well thought out so here is some feedback:\\n\\n1. Current Mailbox is outside of a patient's chart and although the conversation can be saved to a patient record, there is risk that at the point it is saved the conversation may continue and the entire conversation is not saved. I would like to see design so that if a conversation is started outside of a patient chart there is no way to save it to the patient chart thus necessitating that a message that should be in a patient chart is started within a patient chart. or alternatively, some other means that when a mailbox message is started it is immediately tied to a patient thus saving it in the patient chart and making it accessible from the patient chart should the patient call or otherwise make contact anywhere in our system. I know you can select a patient and attach from a patient when composing new mail but it doesn't save the message to the patient chart. We require everyone to review open communications as they may contain information of messages left for a patient that need relayed at the next possible encounter with the patient.\\n2. A patient specific message needs to be able to be routed to staff assigned to groups assigned to providers so that we can get away from department notifications and route messages to staff working roles for individual providers or groups of providers. Triage staff should be sent some messages that need clinical input yet other messages about scheduling may go to a different group and referral request to yet a different group. all based on a role that a person is working that day. Tomorrow they may be working a different role. Our staff do travel that much and work different or multiple roles.\\n3. There should be a PDC card for messages open/incomplete that are unique to a patient in their chart similar to chart communications that can be referenced during a visit or patient contact and completed by anyone.\\n4. I feel there needs to be work on the address book in Communication Center. We now have 6 faxage # and already we identify that each fax # would benefit from their own address book since they are distinctly unique in many ways on who they fax to. Since Mailbox is all internal, I would like to see the ability to carve out entries that are made strictly for faxing from what display when I look up to create a new message. We are also just beginning to start secure texting so I'm not sure how that is going to muddy the address book . We already have duplicates and need to do a clean up. What security behaviors exist around the address book? How can any CPSI representatives that are in the address book be hidden? If users are set up for interface purposes, can they be marked not to show in the address book? Can test MD and users be set not to show in the address book unless we choose to have them show?\\n5. Can there be a discussion about saving messages at a profile level vs a visit level. I was actually signed in to our clinic facility but attached a hospital note and sent it to the PCP. But when I went to attach the communication to an encounter it is only showing me clinic encounter when in reality I felt like this could go to either a clinic or hospital encounter but most definitely needs to show at the patient level in either facility. When patients call they don't always call associated with a specific encounter but with general questions. We always pick the most recent visit because that is what we have to do. It would be nice to progress to placing the message on the patient as a whole.\\n6. When attaching as designed today to an encounter, the Subject line becomes the Document Name, the Document type defaults to Healthcare Communication Document but we have to create and select a Document Category. Can this be reviewed and assessed? Is a document category truly necessary vs a general default category to save us clicks and time? Then it shows in clinical history as a scanned image. How about a new filter for Healthcare Communication Documents so the provider can filter on or off - Messages. In some patients these can be numerous and truly eat up the clinical history app so hiding them would be a blessing. If the provider has them filtered on then it would be nice if incomplete/unanswered ones would display in a different color or with an indicator so the provider could address them or at least be aware of them.\\n\\nI'm sure there will be more but this is what we have for now.

That is, theoretically a nurse could have chart tabs open for all of their patients, have the armband scanned on each, and then go on with their med pass. This negates the safety function built into armband scanning. In a safe system, if one patient\\'s armband was already scanned, scanning a 2nd would kick out the \"scanned\" status of the first.\\n\\nWhile no one endorses the workflow of scanning all patient armbands before beginning a med pass, the fact that it is even possible is a problem.\\n\\nFurther, I can easily think of a scenario where this could become an issue even if the nurse wasn\\'t using a \"questionable\" workflow: nurse is in patient A\\'s room preparing meds, gets interrupted for a urgent need in another room, runs out to take care of that patient, scan\\'s patient B\\'s armband to give a med and then goes back to patient A\\'s room but gets distracted along the way and does not change the chart tab back to patient A. Needing to rescan the armband is a critical safety measure that is needed in this case to ensure that the meds are given to the right patient.\\n\\nThe armband time out feature is helpful in preventing some errors that the ability to have multiple armbands scanned at the same time can cause, but is insufficient as the above scenario could happen pretty quickly. It is difficult to find a time short enough to prevent this but still gives the nurse enough time to complete a med pass on a single patient who has a lot of meds.\\n\\nIdeally, scanning a new armband would kick out the \"scanned\" status of any other armband.

Because medication reconciliation is tied to the NDC, incomplete or incorrect information pulls during the med rec process.\\n\\nRecommendation: the NDC needs to be included in barcode scanning so that clinical monitoring can be done, but it cannot be the only option. There needs to be additional setup so that multiple NDCs can be associated with the same barcode, for meds like a GI cocktail where there are multiple ingredients. There also needs to be additional setup so that a non-NDC barcode number can be generated for scanning that is tied to the NDC for clinical monitoring.

Could a rule be in place that won't allow a 5 digit UBL acknowledging the result in Chart Alerts to clear a providers HS Alert? We do find times when we want the 5 digit UBL to be able to clear these alerts - an in clinic test resulted and reviewed by the provider during the visit still results to the providers HS. We currently have the staff acknowledge them in chart alerts to remove them from the providers HS folder. Maybe some additional work could put these results in their own folder and the provider may or may not subscribe to it.

As it stands, all medication orders in EDIS are automatically designated as one-time STAT orders. This system configuration fails to prompt nurses to perform essential pre-medication pain assessments and does not provide notifications for the necessary reassessment of pain following medication administration.\\n\\nThis gap in functionality poses a significant risk to patient safety, especially given that a substantial number of Emergency Department (ED) patients present with acute pain and require Schedule II or III controlled medications for pain management. Ensuring these patients receive the same standard of care as inpatients is imperative. For inpatients, nurses are prompted at the time of medication administration to do the pre-assessment, and a notification icon appears on the tracking board to alert nurses when a pain reassessment is due. However, this crucial safety feature of pre-medication assessment is absent from the X1 medication orders and the re-assessment notification is not available on the ED tracking board, even when the medication order frequency is adjusted to a PRN (as needed) timeframe.\\n\\nTo address this pressing issue, we urgently need the EDIS to incorporate the following functionalities for all pain medications, regardless of whether they are one-time orders:\\n\\n1. Pre-Medication Pain Assessment Prompt: Nurses must be prompted to perform a pain assessment before administering pain medications. This ensures that the medication is appropriate for the patient's current pain level and condition.\\n2. Pain Reassessment Notification: An alert icon should appear on the ED tracking board to remind nurses to reassess the patient's pain following medication administration. This reassessment is crucial to determine the effectiveness of the pain management plan and to make necessary adjustments.\\n\\nImplementing these features will not only enhance the quality of care provided in the ED but also align the safety standards for ED patients with those for inpatients. The absence of these functionalities can lead to inadequate pain management, delayed reassessment, and potential harm to patients, undermining the overall goal of patient-centered care.\\n\\nWe urge you to prioritize these enhancements in the EDIS to safeguard our patients and ensure that our healthcare providers are equipped with the necessary tools to deliver high-quality, safe, and effective care.\\n\\nThank you for your immediate attention to this critical matter. We look forward to your prompt response and action to address these patient safety concerns.\", 'It would be great to be able to put a PRINT button right on the lab tab, similar to the MAR report for when providers, CRNAs etc or even patients just want to see a copy of the labs.

For some screens like Order Chronology, it even makes sense to allow both single and double clicks since a double click opens an Order Detail screen. But other functions in the program should be restricted to register only the FIRST mouse click, as in completing XR exams. I'm sure it's possible to program the system to recognize only the first click when selecting complete for an exam in OE maintenance.\\n\\nThe EMR should be as 'user proof' as possible to minimize issues that really don't need to occur and avoid provider frustration. This is definitely one of those places in the system.\", 'When Pharmacy Verifies can free text unit if mis-match to unit table causes charging issues. I propose that the unit field in Pharmacy Verification is a drop down to the units attached to that medication. see SIT#10126490', \"Our pediatric physicians would like the ability to add a patient's growth chart from Reports and Attachments into Notes during their well child check. Currently they are having to manually input the information from the growth charts into the note, but they would like to be able to add the actual chart to their note.\", 'We need to be able to send letters via Thrive to the patients with the results of their CT lung screening exams. These letters would be similar to the mammo letters. We need the system to track that letters have been sent. there are specs for the results by the American College of Radiology. The letters would also contain follow up recomendations.']\n"

      "Currently, in both Thrive UX and TWC users can have more than one armband scanned at the same time. That is, theoretically a nurse could have chart tabs open for all of their patients, have the armband scanned on each, and then go on with their med pass. This negates the safety function built into armband scanning. In a safe system, if one patient's armband was already scanned, scanning a 2nd would kick out the \"scanned\" status of the first.\n",

      "Further, I can easily think of a scenario where this could become an issue even if the nurse wasn't using a \"questionable\" workflow: nurse is in patient A's room preparing meds, gets interrupted for a urgent need in another room, runs out to take care of that patient, scan's patient B's armband to give a med and then goes back to patient A's room but gets distracted along the way and does not change the chart tab back to patient A. Needing to rescan the armband is a critical safety measure that is needed in this case to ensure that the meds are given to the right patient.\n",

      "The armband time out feature is helpful in preventing some errors that the ability to have multiple armbands scanned at the same time can cause, but is insufficient as the above scenario could happen pretty quickly.

      "Ideally, scanning a new armband would kick out the \"scanned\" status of any other armband. Enabling facilities to limit the number of chart tabs that a user can have open at any given time would also be acceptable. Preferably this would be set by role, not by facility.\n",
